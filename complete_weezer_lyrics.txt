CALIFORNIA KIDS
When you wake up
Cobwebs on your eyelids
Stuck in rigor mortis
Woah-woah
Just get going
'Til you hit the ocean
And you turn Californian
Woah-woah
You don't have to have the answers
Don't you worry
Don't you worry

It's gonna be alright
If you're on a sinking ship (oo-wee-oo)
The California kids
Will throw you a lifeline
And if you're up all night
Thinking about something you did (oo-wee-oo)
The California kids
Will show you the sunshine

In your bare feet
In mid-January
Swimming in the mystery
Woah-woah
Second-guessing
Almost everything
Don't you worry
Don't you worry

It's gonna be alright
If you're on a sinking ship (oo-wee-oo)
The California kids
Will throw you a lifeline
And if you're up all night
Thinking about something you did (oo-wee-oo)
The California kids
Will show you the starlight

All your old friends
Chilling back in Boston
You never forgot them
Woah-woah

It's gonna be alright
If you're on a sinking ship (oo-wee-oo)
The California kids
Will throw you a lifeline
And if you're up all night
Thinking about something you did (oo-wee-oo)
The California kids
Will show you the sunshine
The California kids
Will show you the starlight

Gonna rock and dance
Gonna hit the ground
With a brand new sound
Looking for romance

Hey, hey, hey
You know what you want me to say
Right, right

We could start a glorious day

Glorious children on my mind
Glorious wastings of my time
Glorious plans we make up
Forcing things in line

Hey, hey, hey

Standing in the light

Gonna do it right
Standing in the light
Flexing all our clout
Gonna do it right
Standing in the light
Flexing all our clout
TRIPPIN' DOWN THE FREEWAY
I told you that you had put on some weight
You went out with somebody named Kevin Green
You preferred to go to a volleyball game
I told you that you couldn't be more lame

No way, we ain't going to break up
We made a promise and our will won't fade out
Not just in '08 and '09
We'll be together from now until the end of time
You've got the Shiri Appleby look
I'm totally caught up on your hook
You know that we are going to be OK
We'll stick together as we're tripping down the freeway

You withheld the physical love I need
I said, "Hey, then I'm going to play the field"
You broke down and told me you loved me true
I said, "girl, I got to be with you"

No way, we ain't going to break up
We made a promise and our will won't fade out
Not just in '09 and '10
We'll be together from now until the very end
You've got the Shiri Appleby look
I'm totally caught up on your hook
You know that we are gonna be OK
We'll stick together as we're tripping down the freeway

No way, we ain't going to break up
We made a promise and our will won't fade out
Not just in oh-ten and oh-eleven
We'll be together from now until we're up in heaven
You've got the Shiri Appleby look
I'm totally caught up on your hook
You know that we are going to be OK
We'll stick together as we're tripping down the freeway

Tripping down the freeway! 
EL SCORCHO
El Scorcho!
Ay carumba!

Goddamn you half-Japanese girls
Do it to me every time
Oh, the redhead said you shred the cello
And I'm jello, baby
But you won't talk, won't look, won't think of me
I'm the epitome of public enemy
Why you wanna go and do me like that?
Come down on the street and dance with me

I'm a lot like you, so please
Hello, I'm here, I'm waiting, oh
I think I'd be good for you
And you'd be good for me

I asked you to go to the Green Day concert
You said you never heard of them (how cool is that)
How cool is that?
So I went to your room and read your diary:
"Watching Grunge leg drop New Jack through a press table..."
And then my heart stopped:
"Listening to Cio-Cio San
Fall in love all over again." (Ow!)

I'm a lot like you, so please
Hello, I'm here, I'm waiting
I think I'd be good for you
And you'd be good for me

How stupid is it? I can't talk about it
I gotta sing about it and make a record of my heart
How stupid is it? Won't you gimme a minute
Just come up to me and say hello to my heart
How stupid is it? For all I know you want me too
And maybe you just don't know what to do
Or maybe you're scared to say: 'I'm falling for you'


I wish I could get my head out of the sand
'Cause I think we'd make a good team
And you would keep my fingernails clean
But that's just a stupid dream that I won't realize
'Cause I can't even look in your eyes without shaking
And I ain't faking
I'll bring home the turkey if you bring home the bacon

I'm a lot like you, so please
Hello, I'm here, I'm waiting (Waiting, oh)
I think I'd be good for you
And you'd be good for me (Oh-hoo!)

(I'm a lot like you) I'm a lot like you
(I'm a lot like you) I'm waiting, oh
I think I'd be good for you
And you'd be good for me, woo!
CAN'T KNOCK THE HUSTLE
Hasta luego, hasta luego
Hasta luego, adios

My manager's slacking so I gotta move quick
I'm lacking in natural gifts
I'm an ugly motherfucker, but I work hella harder
And you can write a blog about it

Can't knock the hustle (Ooh-hoo)
Can't knock the hustle (Oh no)
Leave a five star review and I'll leave you one, too
Can't knock the hustle (Yeah, yeah)

Hasta luego, hasta luego
Hasta luego, adios

The future's so bright, I gotta poke my eyes out
Running up my credit cards (Ooh ooh ooh)
Sellin' lemonade by the side of the road
You see it all from where you are (Oh)

Can't knock the hustle (No, no, no, oh)
Can't knock the hustle (No, no, no, no)
Leave a five star review and I'll leave you one, too
Can't knock the hustle (ooh)

Hasta luego, hasta luego
Hasta luego, adios
Hasta luego, hasta luego
Hasta luego, adios (Bye bye)

Don't step to me
Don't step to me
Don't step to me, bitch

Now you can criticize me for anything
I ain't like them other boys (Oh)
Higher education is the key to escape (Ooh)
But I never learned to roll a joint

Can't knock the hustle (Oh)
Can't knock the hustle (Oh)
Leave a five star review and I'll leave you one, too
Can't knock the hustle (Yeah, ooh)

Hasta luego, hasta luego (Right)
Hasta luego, adios
Hasta luego (Oh), hasta luego (Oh)
Hasta luego, adios (Oh, bye bye)
(Oh, oh, ooh, ooh, bye bye)
I DON'T WANT TO LET YOU GO
All the times you came to me and told me that you cared
I was dreaming of happy days that we both could share
Maybe I got too excited, and maybe you freaked out
Maybe I just have to call you up and scream and shout
All of my friends tell me that I ought to play it cool
No one likes too much attention from a desperate fool
Still I don't believe that I can keep it all inside
When I see your pretty face, I almost want to cry

I know it isn't right
But still I have to fight
I have to let you know
I don't want to let you go

The pain is killing me
But I can't let it be
I have to let you know
I don't want to let you go

I remember the days when I was stronger than a wall
Try as anybody might, they couldn't move me at all
Now I fall to pieces when you softly call my name
Going up in smoke rings like a moth within your flame
I have lost all hope of being normal once again
I will be a slave to you until the bitter end
Even if it's a hundred years before you change your mind
I will be here waiting girl until the end of time
IT'S EASY
Let's not be mean to each other
There's no need for name callin'
There's no need for chain ballin'
Let's be nice, babe, it won't kill us

Let's just be kind to each other
There's no need to argue further
There's no need a chain of order
Let's be nice, babe, it won't kill us

I caught you, I called you on it
You lied to me, you lied all about it
Give it time, give it up
Draw the line, raise the cup
It's easy (Easy)
Not to be mean

Let's work it through and discuss it
There's not need for the cussin'
There's no use for ballbustin'
Let's be nice, babe, it won't kill us, oh

I caught you, I called you on it
You lied to me, you lied all about it
Give it time, give it up
Draw the line, raise the cup
It's easy (Easy)
Not to be mean


I caught you, I called you on it
You lied to me, you lied all about it
Give it time, give it up
Draw the line, raise the cup
It's easy (Easy)
Not to be mean

...time, give it up
Draw the line, raise the cup
It's easy (Easy)
Not to be mean
It's so easy (Easy)
So easy (Easy)
So easy (Easy), yeah
So easy (Easy)
TOO LATE TO TRY
I don't want to die
Even though I have to
I just want to live a long, long time
And I see the gang to which I belong
Time to sing out our happy song
Wouldn't it be a cruel joke
If it's too late to try? Why?
I don't wanna grow
Even if it's good growth
I just wanna stay just like this
And I see the comfortable place to rest
Time to get this shit off my chest
Wouldn't it be a cruel joke
If it's too late to try? Why?
And I see the comfortable place to rest
Time to get this shit off my chest
Wouldn't it be a cruel joke if it's true?
And I see the comfortable place to rest
Time to get this shit off my chest
Wouldn't it be a cruel joke
If it's too late to try? Why?
Too
Late to try
Too
Late to try
And I never swear like that
And I never lose my mind
And I never cry like that
And I never swear like that
And I never lose my mind
LULLABY
Get up and leave the baby
You're going to drive him crazy
And there's a bed just in the other room
He has a task before him
Before this he needs snoring
Sweet solitude for ages at a time
It's not that he don't love you
You are his mommy dearest
But in the nightime he only needs himself
Go entertain the neighbors
Leave him to cogitate
And in the morning you'll leave a glass of milk
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh.....
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh.....
It's not that he don't love you
You are his mommy dearest
But in the nightime he only needs himself
Go entertain the neighbors
Leave him to cogitate
And in the morning you'll leave a glass of milk
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh.....
It's not that he don't love you
You are his mommy dearest
But in the nightime he only needs himself
He only needs himself....
Oh, oh

THE GIRL GOT HOT
Woah woah woah
Went to a show last Saturday night
The band was doing their thing
The moshpit started, and then the crowd parted
And there was Kiki Dee
Knew this girl back in junior high school
When nobody gave her a look
Look at what we got, the girl got hot
Switched up and rewrote the book

Satin tights, boots so white
Leopard handbag out of sight
What used to mean a little
Now means a lot
Oh my goodness me
The girl got hot

Woah woah woah
The first thing I did when I got up the nerve
Was say, "Hey baby, what's up?" (What up?)
She kept on dancing, refused my romancing
And that's when I fell in love
I stepped to the floor with her best friend Jill
And tried to thicken the plot
The thing I finally found with these other girls in town
She got hot, they did not


Nah nah nah...
Satin tights, boots so white
Leopard handbag out of sight (Out of sight)
Regal feather in her feathered hair
Dash of rouge, buyer beware
What used to mean a little
Now means a lot
Oh my goodness me
The girl got hot
SMART GIRLS
Where did all these smart girls come from?
I don't think that I could choose just one
Where did all these smart girls come from?
Someone tell me how to get me some
On the floor, in the car
On the seat at the bar
Wherever I go
That's where they are

Smart girls
Never get enough, of those
Smart girls
Smart girls

I want to be a bad boy right now
Real me is dying to hang out
I know you know what I'm talking about
I've got a feeling you could show me how
On a bus, on a train
On a boat, on a plane
I'm falling in love
What was your name?

Smart girls
Never get enough, of those
Smart girls
Sleeping in the buff

Yumi, Sherie, Alison, Mary
Which one do I want to marry?
They’re all smart girls
They’re all smart girls
Sheena, Lola, Fabiola
Don’t you know you make me lose my mind?
Where did all these smart girls come from?
I don't think that I could choose just one
Where did all these smart girls come from?
Someone tell me how to get me some
Lisa, Brittany, Paula, Whitney
Which one do I want here with me?
They're all smart girls
They're all smart girls
Debbie, Donna, Tatiana
Don't you know you make me lose my mind?
DREAMIN'
I'm dreaming in the morning
I'm dreaming all through the night
And when I'm dreaming I know that it's all right
Woo-hoo-hoah
I'm dreaming in the evening
Dreaming all through the day
And when I'm dreaming I know that it's okay
Woo-hoo-hoah

Daddy says I got to pay some bills
So I can learn to be responsible
Someday I'll have a family of my own
And they will need for me to be full grown

I'm dreaming in the morning
I'm dreaming all through the night
And when I'm dreaming I know that it's all right
Woo-hoo-hoah
I'm dreaming in the evening
Dreaming all through the day
And when I'm dreaming I know that it's okay
Woo-hoo-hoah

Teacher says I got to learn some facts
So I can make it in the Widener Stacks
These are days that will define my life
I shouldn't waste them on these friends of mine
But oh, I got to be a big boy
(Because I really want a chance)
Whoa, I got to pick up my toys
(Because I really want a chance)
When I start to feel the feeling coming over me
(I really want a chance)
I soon forget all about responsibility
(I really want a chance)
I walk around in a wide-awake daydream
(I really want a chance)
Things are better out here than they might seem
There are bluebirds in the meadow
And the bees are flying around
And the goslings at the river
At a loss so far from the ground

I am running through the meadow
And the sun is shining on me
I am singing, my voice is ringing
I can sing so loud

And the angels in the heavens
They are wondering
Why am I so glad?
Why am I so glad?
Why am I so?
Why am I so?

I am running through the meadow
And the sun is shining on me
I am singing, my voice is ringing
I can sing so loud

I'm dreaming in the morning
I'm dreaming all through the night
And when I'm dreaming I know that it's all right
Woo-hoo-hoah
I'm dreaming in the evening
Dreaming all through the day
And when I'm dreaming I know that it's okay
Woo-hoo-hoah

I don't want to get with your program
I don't want to get with your program
I don't want to get with your program
Take back the love
LET IT ALL HANG OUT
I was driving this morning
And sat in traffic on the way to work, work
Soon as I got in, my boss is tripping
And acting like a freaking jerk
Me and my girl ain't speak in weeks
And I can't remember the reason why, why, why
On top of that it's a recession
I feel like Jay-Z; This can't be life

Tonight I'm leaving all my worries
And my problems in the house
I'm going out with my homies
And we going to let it, going to let it
All hang out, let it all hang out
It's the last day of the weekend, boy I need to release
And let it all hang out, let it all hang out
I'm going out with my homies and we going to let it all hang out

The time for me to leave this place
Don't feel like its going to come, come, come
I got bills on top of bills
And I don't know where I'm getting my money from, from
The walls feel like their closing in
I honestly don't feel like I can make it, make it, make it
I'm sad and mad and I can't take it, that's why


Me and JD chilling in the shack
Sharing Chiclets from the same pack
180-proof Vitamin Water
Energy flavor
Take us to your daughter
I want to see you pretty ladies on the dance floor (dance floor)
Put your hands up in the air like you don't care no more (we don't care no more)
We going to hit the town tonight, we were born to rock
BOOBY TRAP
Perfect beauty

Was it all just a deathtrap
Pulled me in and then shut snaps?
Stupid

Come to get me?

Going mental?
I am not a pushover
How did I get won over?
Stupid

Told me it was true
Now I'm goin to pay the price

BRIGHTENING DAY
My best friends are gone
Far and way beyond
And they left me here with no one by my side
How can I get by
With no one to 
And pick me back up when I fall down?
My support 
Me and I'm 
About things I need to help me make it  through
Now what can I do
With no cheer
There to make me feel like I don't suck?
Ooh whoa whoa whoa
Oh whoa whoa oh
There was a brightening day

Ooh whoa whoa whoa
Oh whoa whoa oh
There was a brightening day
My whole  has split
They don't give a spit
About  but themselves
So we'll burn in hell
And think that it's swell
Just as long as we get our own rooms
So we'll burn in hell
And think that it's swell
Just as long as we get our own rooms
RUN OVER BY A TRUCK
I used to sing songs at the break of the day
Zippa dee doo da, Zippa dee yay
Working myself into a frenzy
But I don't do that, no more, no way
I used to like-a learn how to speak in Chinese
O kudasai means baby would you please
Conjugating verbs with the greatest of ease
But I fell down hard on my bended knees
I feel like I've been run over by a truck
I don't care much about anything
I'm happy to sing
I'm lacking the passion to do anything
I feel like I've been run over by a truck
I don't care much about anything
So give me a ring
And tell me to wake up and do anything
I used to play b-ball down at the park (park)
Running up the sideline until it got dark (dark)
Outside step-over with my right foot
Push off with the outside of my left foot (foot)
I used to chat up the girls out in the club (club)
Looking for one of them to give me some love (love)
The show wasn't over till the doughboy come
Old, young, fat, dumb, I love everyone
I feel like I've been run over by a truck
I don't care much about anything
I'm happy to sing
I'm lacking the passion to do anything
I feel like I've been run over by a truck
I don't care much about anything
So give me a ring
And tell me to wake up and do anything
Grandma never was a pushover
Ain't nobody try to step to her
She could teach a common hustler to dance in France
Till the plane came a-crashing down
On the way to see the Cleveland Browns
She was scrambling on fourth down
How I wish that I had been around
Ohhhhooooo
Ohhhhooooo
Ohhhhooooo
How I wish that I had been around
I feel like I've been run over by a truck
I don't care much about anything
I'm happy to sing
I'm lacking the passion to do anything
I feel like I've been run over by a truck
I don't care much about anything
So give me a ring
And tell me to wake up and do anything
I feel like I've been run over by a truck
HEART SONGS
Gordon Lightfoot sang a song about a boat that sank
In the lake at the break of the morning
A cat named Stevens found a faith he could believe in
And Joan Baez, I never listened to too much jazz
But hippie songs could be heard in our pad
Eddie Rabbitt sang about how much he loved a rainy night
Abba, Devo, Benatar were there the day John Lennon died
Mr. Springsteen said he had a hungry heart
Grover Washington was happy on the day he topped the charts
These are the songs

These are my heart songs
They never feel wrong
And when I wake for goodness sake
These are the songs I keep singin'

Quiet Riot got me started with the bangin' of my head
Iron Maiden, Judas Priest and Slayer taught me how to shred
I gotta admit though, sometimes I would listen to the radio
Debbie Gibson, tell me that you think we're all alone
Michael Jackson's in the mirror, I've gotta have faith if I wanna see clear
Never gonna give you up, wish me love or wishing well
It takes two to make a thing go right, if the Fresh Prince starts a fight
Don't you worry for too long cause you know these are the songs

These are my heart songs
They never feel wrong
And when I wake for goodness sake
These are the songs I keep singin'

Back in 1991, I wasn't havin' any fun
'Til my roommate said, "Come on and put a brand new record on"
Had a baby on it, he was naked on it
Then I heard the chords that broke the chains I had upon me
Got together with my bros, in some rehearsal studios
Then we played our first rock show
And watched the fan base start to grow
Signed the deal that gave the dough to make a record of our own
The song come on the radio, now people go, this is the song

These are my heart songs
They never feel wrong
And when I wake for goodness sake
These are the songs I keep singing
These are the songs I keep singing
These are the songs I keep singing
These are the songs I keep singing
These are the songs I keep singing
LONG TIME SUNSHINE
Sometimes I wanna pack it all up
Get on a bus and move to Vermont
Or Maine, or any of those states back East
That I remember
Sometimes I wanna go back to school
An East Coast college with some history
I'd be satisfied, I know
In the simple things

Longtime sunshine
Longtime sunshine upon me

Sometimes I wanna build a house
With a woodstove or a fireplace
And in the middle of the living room
An old piano
Sometimes it don't seem so bad
To settle down with a good woman
And leave this lonely life behind
Forever and ever

Longtime sunshine
Longtime sunshine upon me
Longtime sunshine
Longtime (time) sunshine upon me

Goodbye, friends, goodbye, my girl
Close my eyes as you fly away
Keep on goin' 'til you get someplace
Where you can truly rest

Longtime sunshine
Longtime sunshine upon me
Longtime sunshine
Longtime sunshine upon me

(Why bother?)
(It's gonna hurt me)
(It's gonna kill when you desert me)
(Blast off, up to the stars we go)
(And leave behind everything I used to know)
(Somebody's givin' me a whole lot of money to do what I think I want to)
(So why am I still feelin' blue?)
(Oh, Wuan and Dondo)
Why?
I DO
All the times you came
I should've ran away
You told me that you'd always love me
You told me that you'd always love me
And the games you played
Were meant to lead me on
You told me that you'd always love me
You told me that you'd always love me
Always, oooh always
I do
You told me that you'd always love me
You told me that you'd always love me
Always, oooh always
I do
Never more again
Will I believe the sun
THE VICTOR (APRIL 2002 VERSION)
You like me
I like you
And we're lyin' beneath the sun

The words that you told me have become
A dagger in my back
And the battle is all but won
Cryin' for the victor cuz she's dumb

Taking off your clothes was all that you could do
To hurt me back so bad when I was hurting you


Taking off your clothes was all that you could do
To hurt me back so bad when I was hurting you

A dagger in my back
And the battle is all but won
I like you
And we're lyin' beneath the sun
I like you
And we're lyin' beneath the sun
FONTANA
Weakened knee joints
Stomach flutters
Shaking elbows
Still demand
That I ask you
For an answer
To the question
Here at hand
Why did he reach out to you just now
Touch your hand and say goodbye?
You can hear him
Breathin’ heavy
With a sound so
Physical
In his blue jeans
He’s bow-legged
And he’s stupid
Like a bull
Why did he reach out to you just now
Touch your hand and say goodbye?
How’s a man supposed to stand up so tall
When he feels that he could die?
Can you hear him?
WHERE'S MY SEX?
Mom made my sex
She knitted it with her hands
Sex-making is
A family tradition
Going back to the caveman days
They were walking around in a haze
Until they figured it out
And they said
"Gosh dang, this is great!"
But now I'm like a prehistoric screwball
Walking around with no sex at all, I said

Where's my sex?
I thought it was here
Under the bench
But it isn't there
I've got no idea where it disappeared to
I'm running late, I can't be late
I can't go out without my sex
It's cold outside if my toes get wet
And people will think that I'm an alien
Just cruising in to make a friend

Meg likes to hide it
She says that it gives her a kick
It may be under the rug
Or stuck in a shoe closet
Or tumbling around in the washing machine
She's always trying to get me clean
She adds detergent and Bounce to eliminate static cling
It's going to be another hour or more
Until I am ready to walk out the door, I said


People can you hear me talking
I know you all are happy, rawking
Could you lend me a dime ... pretty please?
Brother, sister got time? I got no
Sex on my feet
Sex in my drawer
Sex in my shoes
Or sex on the floor, I said
DEATH AND DESTRUCTION
I can't say that you love me
So I cry, and I'm hurtin'

Every time that I call you
You find some way to ditch me

So I learned to turn
And look the other way


So I learned to turn
And look the other way

RULING ME
Ring ring goes your telephone
You act like you ain't at home
You shut me out but it turns me on
Red lipstick, black dresses
A look that I should not mess with
It makes us boys go crazy for you

So fascinating, I'm anticipating
The touch that may never come

In the rain, in the sun
Everybody needs someone
They can dream of all night long
All the pain and the ways
That you're driving me insane
It's no mystery
Why you're ruling me

We first met in the lunch room
My ocular nerve went pop, zoom
I've never observed such a beautiful face
Sweet lady, don't play me
If I am a knob, don't fade me
You can't win the game if you pass the Ace

I'm so frustrated
This love's belated, methinks
Let's get it to go

In the rain, in the sun
Everybody needs someone
They can dream of all night long
All the pain and the ways
That you're driving me insane
It's no mystery
Why you're ruling me

I'm not kidding anymore
This love hurts, that's for sure
I feel you, I see you
I need you

In the rain, in the sun
Everybody needs someone
They can dream of all night long
All the pain and the ways
That you're driving me insane
It's no mystery
Why you're ruling me
LIFE IS WHAT YOU MAKE IT
Baby, life's what you make it
Can't escape it
Baby, yesterday's favourite
Don't you hate it
Baby, life's what you make it
Don't backdate it
Baby, Don't try to shade it
Beauty is naked
Baby, life's what you make it
Celebrate it
Anticipate it
Yesterday's faded
Nothing can change it
Life's what you make it
LIVING WITHOUT YOU
I wanna go
To see your house
To see how you're living
(Living without you)
And if you care
I'm wanting you
From such a distance
(Living without you)
And if you want to try
To speak to me again
I'll be your best of friends
Whoa, ohhh, ohhh
And I want you
Ohhh, ohhh, oohh
The things you wrote
To cut me off
When I was trying
(Living without you)
To get with you
To be your friend
Made me feel so bad
(Living without you)
And if you want to try
To speak to me again
I'll be your best of friends
Whoa, ohhh, ohhh
And I want you
Ohhh, ohhh, oohh
Yeah, sweet girl
I need you
Yeah, I think it could be so good
(Instrumental interlude)
(Living without you)
(Living without you)
And if you want to try
To speak to me again
I'll be your best of friends
Whoa, ohhh, ohhh
And I want you
Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh
Yeah, sweet girl
I need you
Yeah, I think it could be so good
ISLAND IN THE SUN
Hip hip
Hip hip
Hip hip
Hip hip

When you're on a holiday
You can’t find the words to say
All the things that come to you
And I wanna feel it too

On an island in the sun
We’ll be playing and having fun
And it makes me feel so fine
I can’t control my brain

Hip hip
Hip hip

When you're on a golden sea
You don’t need no memory
Just a place to call your own
As we drift into the zone

On an island in the sun
We’ll be playing and having fun
And it makes me feel so fine
I can’t control my brain

We'll run away together
We'll spend some time forever
We'll never feel bad anymore

ALWAYS
Always sing your love to me softly
Sweetly turn the pages on always
In the night I was born
Lived a new summer morn
Always, sing your love come to me
Cause I was destined to be
Always rue the day that I loved you
Sweetness came on down from above you
In the night I was born
Lived a new summer morn
Always, sing your love come to me
Cause I was destined to be
No control
In your arms
Letting go
I hope you cope with me tonight
In the night I was born
Lived a new summer morn
Always, sing your love come to me
Cause I was destined to be
THANK GOD FOR GIRLS
The girl in the pastry shop with the net in her hair
Is making a cannoli for you to take on your hiking trip
In the woods with your bros
That you’ve known since second grade
And you may encounter dragons or ruffians and be called upon
To employ your testosterone
In a battle for supremacy
And access to females glued to the TV
And even if you are victorious
You may receive many cuts, bruises, and scrapes
And you will require band aids and antiseptic ointments
And tender loving kisses on your stab wounds
And when you come home
She will be there waiting for you with a fire in her eyes
And a big fat cannoli to shove in your mouth
And that's why you

Thank God for girls
Holla Jesu Christe
From Tennessee to LA
Thank God for girls
On your reckoning day
You better bow down and pray

She’s so big
She’s so strong
She’s so energetic in her sweaty overalls
Thank God for girls

I'm so glad I got a girl to think of even though she isn't mine
I think about her all the day and all the night
It's enough to know that she's alive
She says I give her sweaty palms
She almost had a heart attack
The truth is that I’m just as scared I don’t know how to act
I wish that I could get to know her better
But meeting up in real life would cause the illusion to shatter
I carved her name into all the trees
Sang a song down on one knee
Looking at the underwear page of the Sears catalog
Like when I was 14
I’m levitating like a magnet turned the wrong way around
I’m like an Indian Fakir tryna’ meditate on a bed of nails with my pants pulled down

Thank God for girls
Holla Jesu Christe
From Tennessee to LA
Thank God for girls
On your reckoning day
You better bow down and pray

She’s so big
She’s so strong
She’s so energetic in her sweaty overalls
Thank God for girls
Thank God for girls (Thank God for girls)
Thank God for girls

God took a rib from Adam, ground it up in a centrifuge machine
Mixed it with cardamom and cloves, microwaved it on the popcorn setting
While Adam was like “that really hurts”
Going off into the tundra, so pissed at God
And he started lighting minor forest fires, stealing osprey eggs
Messing with the bees who were trying to pollinate the echinacea
Until God said, “I'm a smite you with loneliness
And break your heart in two”
And Adam wept and wailed, tearing out his hair
Falling on his knees, looked to the sky and said
“Thank God”
IIM YOUR DADDY
I thought tonight would suck like every other night
I'd party with my friends
But when I saw you grooving on the dance floor
Normal came to an end
We started talking and man, it was so clear to me
There's no one else like you
You got the brains, the body and the beauty
To top it off you're cool
This ain't impossible
This ain't improbable
You are my baby tonight
And I'm your daddy
This ain't believable
This ain't predictable
You are my baby tonight
And I'm your daddy
I hope that I ain't freaking you out
You probably hear it all the time
I swear I ain't like those other boys
I'm a special kind
I would like to give a demonstration
Of what it is I do
I'll take you out to dinner at Palermo's
We'll split a cheese fondue
This ain't impossible
This ain't improbable
You are my baby tonight
And I'm your daddy
This ain't believable
This ain't predictable
You are my baby tonight
And I'm your daddy
I will egg the goomba if you tire
Try my best to moonwalk on the wire
I just want to ooh, ah, feel your fire
Feel your fire, feel your fire
This ain't impossible
This ain't improbable
You are my baby tonight
And I'm your daddy
This ain't believable
This ain't predictable
You are my baby tonight
And I'm your daddy
THE STORY IS WRONG
Don't you think that the story is wrong?
The introduction goes on too long
You have to sing but you don't know a song
But it's not so bad
It's not the same thing everyday
And it's a clear and a beautiful day
And I guess there isn't much to say
Don't you think that my prospects are good?
Of being totally misunderstood
You said I can't but I know that I could
But it's not so bad
It's not the same thing everyday
And it's a clear and a beautiful day
And I guess there isn't much to say
But it's not so bad
It's not the same thing everyday
And it's a clear and a beautiful day
And I guess there isn't much to say
MYKEL & CARLI
Back in Wilson High
I had two best friends
They lived down the block
Where Eagle Court bends
One she cared for my bones
Fed me ice cream cones
One she cared for my happiness
Wouldn't leave me alone

Back in Wilson High
See I had these two best friends
Till the school bus came
And took my friends away
Now I'm left alone at home
To sit and think all day

Hear you me, Mykel
Hear you me, Carli

They gave me a hat
The hat was awful rad
Wore it every day
Made my teacher mad
She tore it off my head
Now my head's well red
My head gets cold at night sometimes
But I can't be misled

Back in Wilson High
I had two best friends
They lived down the block
Where Eagle Court bends
Till the school bus came
And took my friends away
Now I'm left alone at home
To sit and think all day
BUTTERFLY
Yesterday, I went outside
With my momma's mason jar
Caught a lovely butterfly
When I woke up today
Looked in on my fairy pet
She had withered all away
No more sighing in her breast

I'm sorry for what I did
I did what my body told me to
I didn't mean to do you harm
Every time I pin down what I think I want, it slips away
The ghost slips away

Smell you on my hand for days
I can't wash away your scent
If I'm a dog, then you're a bitch
I guess you're as real as me
Maybe I can live with that
Maybe I need fantasy
Life of chasing butterfly

I'm sorry for what I did
I did what my body told me to
I didn't mean to do you harm
Every time I pin down what I think I want, it slips away
The ghost slips away

I told you I would return
When the robin makes his nest
But I ain't never coming back

I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
UNSPOKEN
Every morning, every day
I am hoping for the chance to get away
In the evening, every night
I am dreaming of a chance to make it right
Every chance that I get
I am placing a bet
On the sun in the sky

And if you take this away from me
I'll never forgive you, can't you see?
Our life will be broken
Our hate will be unspoken

I can feel those metal chains
And they're holding back the hope that keeps me sane
I can fight back, yes I can!
Because I'm strong enough to show you I'm a man
And I hate what you do
When your poison seeps through
And you're laughing at me


Every chance that I get
I am placing a bet
On the sun in the sky
As it sets out of sight
And I hate what you do
When your poison seeps through
And you're laughing at me
NO ONE ELSE
My girl's got a big mouth
With which she blabbers a lot
She laughs at most everything
Whether it's funny or not
And if you see her
Tell her it's over now

I want a girl who will laugh for no one else
When I'm away, she puts her makeup on the shelf
When I'm away, she never leaves the house
I want a girl who laughs for no one else

My girl's got eyeballs
In the back of her head
She looks around and around
You know, it makes me sad to see her like that
Please don't believe her
She says that for anyone
And if you see her
Tell her it's a hey, hey, hey, hey

I want a girl who will laugh for no one else
When I'm away, she puts her makeup on the shelf
When I'm away, she never leaves the house
I want a girl who laughs for no one else
And if you see her
Tell her it's over now


And if you see her
Tell her it's over now
And if you watch her go
Watch her, watch her, watch her, watch her!

I want a girl who will laugh for no one else
When I'm away, she puts her makeup on the shelf
When I'm away, she never leaves the house
I want a girl who laughs for no one else
No one else
Yeah
THE GOOD LIFE
Yeah, check me

When I look in the mirror
I can't believe what I see
Tell me, who's that funky dude
Staring back at me?
Broken, beaten down, can't even get around
Without an old man cane, I fall and hit the ground
Shivering in the cold, I'm bitter and alone

Excuse the bitching
I shouldn't complain
I should have no feeling
'Cause feeling is pain
As everything I need is denied me
And everything I want is taken away from me
But who do I got to blame? Nobody but me

And I don't wanna be an old man anymore
It's been a year or two since I was out on the floor
Shaking booty, making sweet love all the night
It's time I got back to the good life
It's time I got back, it's time I got back
And I don't even know how I got off the track
I wanna go back, yeah

Screw this crap, I've had it! (I've had it!)
I ain't no Mr. Cool
I'm a pig, I'm a dog
So 'scuse me if I drool
I ain't gonna hurt nobody, ain't gonna cause a scene
Just need to admit that I want sugar in my tea
(Hear me?) Hear me? I want sugar in my tea!

And I don't wanna be an old man anymore
It's been a year or two since I was out on the floor
Shaking booty, making sweet love all the night
It's time I got back to the good life
It's time I got back, it's time I got back
And I don't even know how I got off the track
I wanna go back, yeah


I wanna go back, I wanna go back
And I don't even know how I got off the track
It's time I got back, it's time I got back
And I don't even know how I got off the track
I wanna go back, yeah

And I don't wanna be an old man anymore
It's been a year or two since I was out on the floor
Shaking booty, making sweet love all the night
It's time I got back to the good life
It's time I got back, it's time I got back
And I don't even know how I got off the track
It's time I got back, it's time I got back
And I don't even know how I got off the track
I wanna go back
I wanna go back
LOSING MY MIND
It's another night, stumbling around the town
Looking for action, totally wasted and trying to find a date
I could be killed, I could be arrested, but I don't care no more
I just want to find the thrill that I felt once before

I'm losing my mind
I'm going insane
I'm watching my life go down the drain

Maybe I'll find the answers in one of these night clubs
And one of the people I meet, maybe they'll tell me
That everything's going to be fine and we can't quit the wild life we know
We've reached the finish line, honey, now we can go home

I'm losing my mind
I'm going insane
I'm watching my life go down the drain

I'm running out of energy, and I have to lie down
Right here on the sidewalk, next to the shoe town
I hope nobody bothers me because I'm so tired
And empty, life means nothing anymore

I'm losing my mind
I'm going insane
I'm watching my life go down the drain
I'm losing my mind
I'm going insane
I'm watching my life go down the drain
ACAPULCO
Beautiful girl
What're you doing?
All of the times
That I was there
You came down
In my arms
Told me things
No one knew (beautiful girl)
Now you're gone
All of the times
That I was there
You came down
In my arms
Told me things
No one knew (beautiful girl)
Now you're gone
GO AWAY
(Rivers Cuomo)
Cold hearted girl
Don't hurt me like this anymore
I'm waitin' right outside your door
Sayin', "Baby, can we talk?"
(Bethany Cosentino)
Stupid boy
You keep on begging but I won't let you in
You keep on cryin' but you know what ya' did
I'll never let you back in
(Rivers Cuomo)
And you say
(Rivers Cuomo and Bethany Cosentino)
"Go away, go away
Go away, go away, go away
Go away, go away, go away
Don't come back here anymore
Go away"
(Rivers Cuomo)
I was wrong
I hurt your feelings when I did what I did
I learned my lesson, I'll stop actin' like a kid
Can you give me one more chance?
(Bethany Cosentino)
And so I asked
"What does she have that I don't have?"
You said you'd stay, but then you went away
That's why I'm tellin' you to go away
(Rivers Cuomo)
And you say
(Chorus)
(Cuomo and Cosentino)
But my life is incomplete without you, whoa
And you miss the little things that I do
You do
Won't you take me back?
That was your last chance
(Chorus)
(Cuomo and Cosentino)
Go away and don't come back
LOVE IS THE ANSWER
There will come a day
When we transcend our pain
Until that day, take it easy on yourself

Love is the answer
Makes no difference what you have heard
Love is the answer
You have got to trust in the world

There will come a day
When we can finally rest
Until that day, take it easy on yourself


Brothers and sisters
I know you try so hard sometimes
You're going to find your happiness inside


In the world 

Love is the answer
You have got to trust in the world
PORCUPINE
Come on, come on and tell me girl
Did you believe it's true
When I was here and waiting girl?
When I was here with you?
All the blood starts pumpin'
Can't you see? Yeah...
Get out, get out and get some sun
'Cause you be turnin' pale
Now that you see I'm in your face
Blacker than blacker shale
All the blood starts pumpin'
Can't you see?
It's a long long time
Since we fell behind
If you'd spend some time with me
I wanna be with you
All the blood starts pumpin'
Can't you see?
It's a long long time
Since we fell behind
If you'd spend some time with me
I wanna be with you
YOU GAVE YOUR LOVE TO ME SOFTLY
You gave your love to me softly

I heard your heart beating true
Still, your Bijan lingers on and on and on

You gave your love to me softly

When I'm feeling blue and lonely
All I have to do is think of you
We had just one night
But it lingers on and on and on

You gave your love to me softly

"La-la-la," you sang to me
"Baby, don't you cry
Put your arms around me, child
And lay with me tonight."


You gave your love to me softly

"La-la-la," you sang to me
"Baby, don't you cry
Put your arms around me, child
And lay with me tonight."

La-la-la
La-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
UNBREAK MY HEART
Don't leave me in all this pain
Don't leave me out in the rain
Come back and bring back my smile
Come and take these tears away
I need your arms to hold me now
The nights are so unkind
Bring back those nights when I held you beside me

Un-break my heart
Say you'll love me again
Undo this hurt you caused
When you walked out the door
And walked out of my life
Un-cry these tears
I cried so many nights
Un-break my heart
My heart

Take back that sad word good-bye
Bring back the joy to my life
Don't leave me here with these tears
Come and kiss this pain away
I can't forget the day you left
Time is so unkind
And life is so cruel without you here beside me
Don't leave me in all this pain
Don't leave me out in the rain
Bring back the nights when I held you beside me

Un-break my heart
Say you'll love me again
Undo this hurt you caused
When you walked out the door
And walked out of my life
Un-cry these tears
I cried so many, many nights

Un-break my, un-break my heart, oh baby
Come back and say you love me
Un-break my heart, sweet darling
Without you I just can't go on
Say that you love me, say that you love me
MAD KOW
I'm watching and waiting
Disintegrating
I know that you hear me
If you could come near me

But no one can save me now
I'm lost, just like a cow
Madness burning inside my brain
My brain

Falling to pieces
Breaking the leases
I know that you hear me
If you could come near me

But no one can save me now
I'm lost, just like a cow
Madness burning inside my brain
My brain

I know that you hear me
If you could come near me
But no one can save me now
I'm lost, just like a cow

Madness burning inside my brain
No one can save me now
I'm lost, just like a cow
Madness burning inside my brain
My brain
RUNNING MAN
He runs so gracefully
And lives eternally
Hands high
Head high
He steps into the air
As focused in a stare
Moving
Grooving
He takes control
Of the course of his life
He don't need coffee breaks
Subsist on egg and steaks
Moving
Proving
Perfection is a fear
Turning as does a wheel
He's on
He's strong
He takes control
Of the course of his life
He is climbing
He takes control
Of the course of his life
He is climbing
He is climbing
TURN ME ROUND
The day that I first saw you
I knew I had to have you
You were as cute as could be
I needed a family around me
Over the course of the year
I slowly lost my interest
Now you're a pain in the ass
And I have got to leave you
Now, turn me round, turn me round, turn me round
Now, turn me round, turn me round, turn me round
Love all around us
And so I made a promise
Tried my best to keep it
But then I tire of it
Tired of seeing your face
Cleaning up after your mess
Buying the food that you eat
And I have got to leave you
Now, turn me round, turn me round, turn me round
Now, turn me round, turn me round, turn me round
I'm over again, I'm over again
I'm over until I've had enough of you my friend
Tired of seeing your face
Cleaning up after your mess
Buying the food that you eat
And I have got to leave you
Now, turn me round, turn me round, turn me round
Now, turn me round, turn me round, turn me round
Turn me round, turn me round
Turn me round, turn me round!
Turn me round, turn me round, turn me round
Now, turn me round, turn me round, turn me round
FALLING FOR YOU
Holy cow, I think I've got one here
Now just what am I supposed to do?
I've got a number of irrational fears
That I'd like to share with you
First, there's rules about old goats like me
Hanging 'round with chicks like you
But I do like you and another one:
You say 'like' too much

But I'm shaking at your touch, I like you way too much
My baby, I'm afraid I'm falling for you
I'd do 'bout anything to get the hell out alive
Or maybe I would rather settle down with you, oh

Holy moly, baby, wouldn't you know it?
Just as I was busting loose
I gotta go turn in my rock star card
And get fat and old with you
'Cause I'm a burning candle, you're a gentle moth
Teaching me to lick a little bit kinder
And I do like you - you're the lucky one
No, I'm the lucky one

I'm shaking at your touch, I like you way too much
My baby, I'm afraid I'm falling for you
I'd do 'bout anything to get the hell out alive
Or maybe I would rather settle down with you


Holy sweet goddamn
You left your cello in the basement
I admired the glowing stars
And tried to play a tune
I can't believe how bad I suck, it's true
What could you possibly see in little ol' three chord me?
But I do like you and you like me too
I'm ready, let's do it, baby

I'm shaking at your touch, I like you way too much
My baby, I'm afraid I'm falling for you
I'd do 'bout anything to get the hell out alive
Or maybe I would rather settle down...

(Down)
With you (with you)
Down (Down)
With you (with you)
Oh
SURF WAX AMERICA
The sea is foaming like a bottle of beer
The wave is coming but I ain't got no fear
I'm waxing down so that I'll go real fast
I'm waxing down because it's really a blast
I'm going surfing 'cause I don't like your face
I'm bailing out because I hate the race
Of rats that run around and 'round in the maze
I'm going surfing, I'm going surfing!

You take your car to work
I'll take my board
And when you're out of fuel
I'm still afloat

My buddies and their honeys all come along
They seem invincible as they trip along
The sea is rolling like a thousand pound keg
We're going surfing, going surfing!

You take your car to work
I'll take my board
And when you're out of fuel
I'm still afloat
You take your car to work
I'll take my board
And when you're out of fuel
I'm still afloat

All along the undertow is strengthening its hold
I never thought it'd come to this
Now I can never go home
All along the undertow is strengthening its hold
I never thought it'd come to this
Now I can never go home

You take your car to work
I'll take my board
And when you're out of fuel
I'm still afloat
You take your car to work
(All along the undertow is strengthening its hold)
I'll take my board
(I never thought it'd come to this)
And when you're out of fuel
(Now I can never go home)
I'm still afloat
You take your car to work
I'll take my board
And when you're out of fuel
I'm still afloat

You take your car
I'll take my board
You take your car
I'll take my board
Let's go!
HOLD ME
I am terrified of all things
Frightened of the dark
I am
You are taller than a mountain
Deeper than the sea
You are

Hold me
Hold me
Take me with you cause I'm lonely
I was closer to you back then
I was happier
I was
You are fading further from me
Why don't you come home to me

I am...
I am...
Cold
Hold Me

(x3)
HAUNT YOU EVERY DAY
I don't feel the joy
I don't feel the pain
You were just a toy
I am just insane
Walking on my own
Leaving you behind
You were crying out
That you need to speak your mind

Ohhh
So alone in love
So alone in love
I'm gonna haunt you everyday
Haunt you everyday
I am gonna kill
When I need a thrill
Eating at the heart
Until I've had my fill
When will stupid learn?
Fires gonna burn
Think of consequence
Then you move when it's your turn


Walking on my own
Leaving you behind
You are crying out
That you need to speak your mind
HIGH AS A KITE
I think I'm going parasailing
Miles above, it’s so serene
I'm letting go of all the troubles
That I've seen, that I’ve seen
Way up here, no one can touch me
I'm drifting like a lost balloon
I'm out of reach and won't be coming down
Any time soon, any time soon

I'm high as a kite
Don't you think they know what I'm worth?
Flying like a beautiful bird
I'm high as a kite
Don’t you think they know what I’m worth?
Why I gotta come down to earth?

I feel no pain, I feel no pleasure
I only want to disappear
So let me play this game for children
And vanish into the atmosphere

I'm high as a kite
Don’t you think they know what I'm worth?
Flying like a beautiful bird
I'm high as a kite
Don't you think they know what I’m worth?
Why I gotta come down to earth?

When I'm high
And I'm giving up the nightmare chase, woah woah
And all I wanna do is blow my mind, woah woah
All I wanna do is blow my mind
I can fly up to the stratosphere
High above the cirrus clouds
Where I am one with the universe

I'm high as a kite
Don't you think they know what I'm worth?
Flying like a beautiful bird
I'm high
Don't you think they know what I'm worth?
Why I gotta come down to earth when I'm high?
LOVE EXPLOSION
Take a listen around you
All the people that crowd around in your house
They've been wanting to kill you in your sleep

Take a load off and bow down
To the others, they love to call you their names
They've been wanting to kill you in your sleep

And all the bull that people sling
(Love is an ocean)
It doesn't matter what they sing
(Love explosion)

So jump out, jump out and get your groove on
This one is for you, so come on
Get out your house, girl
And give me a kiss


And all the bull that people sling
(Love is an ocean)
It doesn't matter what they sing
(Love explosion)

So jump out, jump out, get your groove on
This one is for you, so come on
Get out your house, girl
And give me a kiss

Take a load off and bow down
To the others, they love to call you their names
They love to call you their names
They love to call you their names
AUTOPILOT
When I wake at the break of the morning
I ingest my two fried eggs
If a grain of the salt is missing
Then I go to the store and beg

Autopilot
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah-yeah
I've got to get off
The autopilot
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah-yeah
It's pissing me off

When I walk to the park with my doggies
I collect all the things they leave
Then I put them up under the microscope
And I'm so impressed by what I see

Autopilot
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah-yeah
I've got to get off
The autopilot
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah-yeah
It's pissing me off

There is passion in my heartache, heartache
Though I'm trained to stay in this state, this state
Ain't no matter how hard I try, I try
I will be here until I die, I die

Ten: Input "What is your name?"
Twenty: Print "Hello"
Thirty: REM
Forty: Input "How much cash do you want?"
Fifty: For I equals 1 to N
Sixty: Print S-string and REM
Seventy: Input "Go to the end"
Eighty: If A-string equals "Be my friend"
Then print "Bad command"

Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah-yeah

MISS SWEENEY
Hi, hello, Miss Sweeney, could you please come in my office for a second?
I'm headin' home for the day and I thought it'd be good for you and me to check in
I met with a gal from expo and they do have the "slab" cabinets in white
She thinks we can take measurements down at the site

If we do that we'll be just fine, Miss Sweeney
That's all I got to say to you at this time, Miss Sweeney
Actually, there's one other thing on my mind

Girl, you make the rainclouds disappear
The sun always shines when you're near
I'm waiting, until you love me
Sweeney

I'm so sorry, Miss Sweeney, I don't know where that came from
I think I was overcome by a spontaneous emotion
Anyway, the cash deposit of five thousand dollars
Will need to be sent to the property owner tomorrow

If there are any problems with the deposit or contract, don't be afraid to holler
I don't wanna have to approve each stinkin' dollar that we borrow
Ah, forget it!

Miss Sweeney
Girl, you make the rainclouds disappear
The sun always shines when you're near
I'm waiting, until you love me

Miss Sweeney, I got to admit the truth
I am totally head-over-heels in love with you
Everyday you come to the office lookin' fine
Navy business suit clingin' tightly to your spine
You ask me if I'm ready to get down to work
Sweeney, baby, I'm ready, be my...

Girl, you make the rainclouds disappear
The sun always shines when you're near
I'm waiting, until you love me...

Girl, you light the skies of my life
I swear, I will make you my wife
I'm waiting, until you love me
Miss Sweeney
Miss Sweeney
PURIFICATION OF WATER
Everybody wanted me
And I knew it myself
Don't drink the water
It's bad for your health
But god, it's hot I had no choice
The sun it burned down on me
Even though they told me so
I drank it deep, drank it deep
Even though, we both know
What we know, we can't say no
The world is blind to what it finds
The world is blind though the sun shines
Now I kneel
Before the sacred basin
And offer up
The sweetest of all sin
But god, it's hot I had no choice
The sun it burned down on me
Even though they told me so
I drank it deep, drank it deep
Even though, we both know
What we know, we can't say no
The world is blind to what it finds
The world is blind though it shines
EVERYBODY WANTS A CHANCE TO FEEL ALL ALONE
I have brought you here tonight
To lay you out upon the stone
You're the girl that loves me best
Part the robe that hides your chest

Darlin', I think it's time that I let you go
And I don't feel any guilt as I touch your throat
You taught me how to sing my songs
What to drink and not to smoke
When to help and who to hate
All for love we suffocate

Everybody wants a chance to feel all alone
Hanging out here beside the old open road
Little one, you have done
All you could to keep me in your arms
Oh, but I want you to choke on your tears
Everybody wants a chance to feel all alone
Suddenly, I feel so strong
I don't hear a single sound
Looking up towards the stars
I can see for very far

Everybody wants a chance to feel all alone
Hanging out here, the open road
Little one, you have done
All you could to keep me in your arms
Oh, but I want you to choke on your tears
Everybody wants a chance to feel all alone
TIME FLIES
Had another birthday, could've been the worst day
I ever had
Got a little drunk, and I fell into a funk
And I woke up sad
Looked into the mirror
There were lines around my eyes

Time flies when you're having fun
Time flies when you live on the run
The harder I go, the more I realize
Time flies

Life is moving fast and I'm running out of gas
Time ain't on my side
I'm still in the race and I'm barely keeping pace
But it's worth the ride
Waiting around the corner
There's another sweet surprise

Time flies when you're having fun
Time flies when you live on the run
The harder I go, the more I realize
Time flies

Hey yeah, hey yeah
Time flies
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Time flies

Some sad day, they'll be taking me away
But I won't be dead
Because even when I'm gone, this stupid dance song
Will be in your head
I'll be looking down with a twinkle in my eyes

Time flies when you're having fun
Time flies when you live on the run
The harder I go, the more I realize
Time flies
BURNING SUN
I'd die for you
Why can't you be the one
To set my mind at ease
I tried for you
But now the burning sun
Is setting on the sea

Ain't nothin' we can do
I gave my strength to you
But if my dream came true I'd hold you every night

I'd fall for you
And get down on my knees
If that would make you smile

Ain't nothin' we can do
I gave my strength to you
But if my dream came true I'd hold you every night


Ain't nothin' we can do
I gave my strength to you
But if my dream came true I'd hold you every night

I'd fall for you
And get down on my knees
If that would make you smile
If that would make you smile
If that would make you smile
SHE WHO IS MILITANT
It looks like
You were never going to be my queen
It looks like
There were to many places you wanna see
Aah, if you ever need some one
I'll be there
I'll be there
It looks like
There are others boys that can put on a show
And it's all good
'Cause in time each and every one of them go
If you ever go your way
I'll be there
I'll be there
I'd like to see you get with him
Its time we settle down knit
You are
You are
Aah, if you ever go your way
I'll be there
I'll be there
I'd like to see you get with him
Its time we settle down and knit
You are
You are
You are
You are
MY WEAKNESS
Everybody, don't make me laugh
Cuz it's not so insane
In the morning it comes to pass
And there's no one to blame
I'll tell you
My weakness
And if you knew the things i say
Then you'd have to believe
In the spirits above the sand
And the man in the tree
I'll tell you
My weakness
If you like it there
I'll be most everywhere
Tell me to stay
Leave me to stay
I'll tell you
My weakness
If you like it there
I'll be most everywhere
Tell me to stay
Leave me to stay
SLAVE
Love, barely alive in your arms
Slave
Dreams, taken too far every night
Slave

Who put on your heart?
Who put on your heart?
Who put on your heart?

'Cause I can't change, no

When you're on your own, you can see
Things
Clear, clear as a bell and you're free
Slave

Who put on your heart?
Who put on your heart?
Who put on your heart?

'Cause I can't change, no

And my girl, we'll say goodbye
To the things we'll never try


Who put on your heart?
Who put on your heart?
Who put on your heart?

'Cause I can't change, no

Love, barely alive
Love, barely alive
Love, barely alive

BYZANTINE
I want Neil Young on your phone speaker in the morning
And fuck him if he just can't see
This is how his songs are supposed to be heard
No more lectures on fidelity
I don’t believe in mysticism
Only in what science proves
Like the sex appeal of your sick dance moves
Ooh, wee, ooh, wee

Put on your red beret, baby
Moonwalk naked across the room (Ooh)
Do something kinda unique to me
Do something that'll make me swoon (Ooh)
That's how I know that I’m not pretending
I know it's not make believe (Ooh)
It's only complicated if you want it to be
Do you know what I mean? It's byzantine

I want Hi-Chews, playlists, smoking on the roof
And I love the way you look at me
Tennessee Williams in Stuart Weitzman boots
Yeah, you're just too wild to believe
A fetish for athletic fashion
Running shoes and striped track suits
I never heard of Sparks before
But I'm so glad you shared them with me

Put on your red beret, baby
Moonwalk naked across the room (Ooh)
Do something kinda unique to me
Do something that'll make me swoon (Ooh)
That's how I know that I’m not pretending
I know it’s not make believe (Ooh)
It's only complicated if you want it to be
Do you know what I mean? It’s byzantine

Rollin', crashin', breakin', splashing
Givin’, takin', makin', breakin' promises
You got me high when I was low
Negative ions, come save my soul (Soul, soul)

Put on your red beret, baby
Moonwalk naked across the room (Ooh)
Do something kinda unique to me
Do something that'll make me swoon (Ooh)
That's how I know that I'm not pretending
I know it's not make believe (Ooh)
It's only complicated if you want it to be
Do you know what I mean? It's byzantine

It's byzantine, it's byzantine
It's byzantine, it's byzantine
DUDE WE'RE FINALLY LANDING
Dude

Dude

Dude

What?

Good news, good news, good news
Now we're finally landing
M1's started scanning
For a possible source
Of the distress call we received

What's so damn important
That you feel that it's necessary
To interrupt me
In my pod

Now we're finally landing
Now we're finally landing
Get your stuff together
'Cause now we're finally gonna land

Good news, good news, good news
Good news, good news, good news
Good news, good news, good news
Good news, good news, good news

So who gives a damn?
FREAK ME OUT
City streets at night
Can be so intimidating
I'm not the toughest guy
I gotta keep my eyes open
You came out of nowhere

Man you really freak me out
I'm so afraid of you
And when I lose my cool
I don't know what to do
I know you don't mean no harm
You're just doing your thing
But man you really freak me out
Did I hurt you?
Are you okay?
Can I buy you a drink?
Oh what's the world coming to?
You came out of nowhere

I'm gonna try to improve my manners (manners)
Everyone, yes everyone, is my friend!

City streets at night (city streets at night)
City streets at night (city streets at night)
Til the morning light (til the morning light)
City streets at night (city streets at night)
GET RIGHT
I've been spending time alone
Thinking 'bout the things that could've been
It's harder on my own
I didn't think it would turn out like this
I made a shrine with pictures of you
I tried and tried to get to the truth
But I'm afraid to look
And choosing one means losing all the rest

I know you're out there waiting for me there
But I don't know if I can get right
I know you're out there waiting for me there
But I don't know if I can get by

Raise your candle high
I would never turn my back on you
I'm your tiger burning bright
Even for just a day or two
There's something you should probably know
I hate to be the man in your phone
With alligator shoes
Cause I really am in love with you

I know you're out there waiting for me there
But I don't know if I can get right
I know you're out there waiting for me there
But I don't know if I can get by

Singing to my door
Keep your fingers crossed
Don't evaporate like a beautiful mirage
I know you're out there waiting for me there
But I don't know if I can get right

Why won't you tell me; I already know the answer
Why won't you tell me it's over; it's over
Why won't you tell me; I already know the answer
Why won't you tell me it's over; it's over

I know you're out there (out there) waiting for me there
But I don't know if I can get right
I know you're out there (out there) waiting for me there
But I don't know if I can get by

Singing to my door
Keep your fingers crossed
Don't evaporate like a beautiful mirage
I know you're out there (out there) waiting for me there
But I don't know if I can get right
TURNING UP THE RADIO
Crunchie! ats5!

What are you playing in my ear?
You got a fix of what it is I want to hear
Coming through the frequencies
And the airwaves
You say I'm acting like a fool
Hey man, back off, because you don't look so cool
With your button down shirt, tie smack
Man you're so whack

Let the music play
Let the good times roll
We don't care what you say
We're turning up the radio

Turning, turning
Got to get it louder
Turning, turning
Let me hear you shouting
Turning, turning
Get yourself together
Turning, turning
Waking up your neighbor

Listen as I start my jam
Tuning into the stations on the stereo
Don't you dare touch that dial
Because I got style
(For miles and miles)
Everybody clap your hands
Grooving to the way I roll with my rock band
You know we're gonna turn back time to the 80s

Let the music play
Let the mohawks grow
We don't care what you say
We're turning up the radio


It's the rock, It's the roll
It's the pop, it's the soul
It's the funk, the hip-hop
Oh, DJ, don't you stop
It's the hits, it's the flops
Billie Jean, and She Bop
It's the cream of the crop
Oh, DJ, don't you stop
Turn it all the way...

Turning, turning, turning up the radio
UNTENABLE
Why are you so untenable?
I want to show my heart is full
Come on and give me one small sign
That I'm not just wasting time
Logic is a useful tool
When you live your life in school
Logic is a useful tool
When you live your life in school
Come on and give me one small sign
That I'm not just wasting time
I love your pictures on the wall
I saw the words that no one saw
No one saw
No one saw
FOOLISH FATHER
Simple love songs
Drenched in blood songs
Coming out all wrong songs

Hesitate to throw your stones
When criminals are victims
Looking back into our past
There's no cause for these symptoms now

Forgive your foolish father
He did the best that he could do
You are his daughter
An' he'd do anything for you

Think of how destroyed he feels
Walking to his grave plot
Knowing that the one he loves
Hates him with all of her heart

Forgive your foolish father
He did the best that he could do
You are his daughter
An' he'd do anything for you

These nucleotides are paired up in a strand
How comical this stuff that makes a man


Forgive your foolish father (Forgive your father)
He did the best that he could do
You are his daughter (You are his daughter)
An' he'd do anything (for you)
Anything for you, anything for you
Anything, anything
Anything for you (Anything for you)

Everything will be alright in the end
Everything will be alright in the end
Everything will be alright in the end
Everything will be alright in the end
Everything, everything, everything will be alright now
Everything will be alright in the end
SATURDAY NIGHT (DC DEMO)
Saturday Night
Ooh how I love that song
Prove to me that I'm wrong
The night away
Give to me girl
All of the love that I need
Ooh, when I'm hungry I feed
The night away
Dreams will never happen to you
Once you feel that freedom is true
I'll be with you
Take a new stance
Boogie in nights like in France
Boogie in nights like in France
The night away (that's right)
Planting your seed
Deep in the heart of the earth
Tryin' to kneel and give birth
The night away
Dreams will never happen to you
Once you feel that freedom is true
I'll be holding on
Holding on
So in love with yourself
With you...
With you...
Dreams will never happen to you
Once you feel that freedom is true
I'll be holding on
Holding on
So in love with yourself
With you...
With you...
With you...
JACKED UP
If I stay the night
Will I fall in love?
If I stroke your hair
It's gonna hurt so much
Stranded in the Kalahari
Will you share your flask?
If I stay the night
Will I fall in love?

I'm all jacked up
Over you
I'd bury diamonds
Just for you
Oh, why, why, why do my flowers always die?
Why do they die?
I'm all jacked up
Over you

I see you standing there
Without a shred of clothes
And I can break away
From the vein of gold
Come you beautiful alien
Touch me with your light
But if I stay the night
Will I fall in love?

I'm all jacked up
Over you
I'd bury diamonds
Just for you
Oh, why, why, why do my flowers always die?
Why do they die?
I'm all jacked up
Over you

You're the sun that I'm orbiting
I burn in your heat
Supernova and cosmic dust
You spawn galaxies
We'll sleep together
Sleep together
Sleep forever
Sleep together
Sleep forever minus one
Say those forbidden words to me, eagle girl

I'm all jacked up
Over you
I'd bury diamonds
Just for you
Oh, why, why, why do my flowers always die?
Why do they die?
I'm all jacked up
Over you
O GIRL
Aaah
O girl, you look sad
Burnt out and half gone mad
Still filling up the place
With tears on your face
Freaked out and scared to move
You don't wanna have to prove
That you're among the same
Pining away
O girl, I thought you were cool
Until you tried not to get hurt
But now I see in your eyes
The pain that can't be just mine
You're like me
O girl, you're trembling
??? ...and stumbling
That you're among the same
Please go away
O girl, I thought you were cool
Until you tried not to get hurt
But now I see in your eyes
The pain that can't be just mine
You're like me
AMERICAN GIGOLO
Sit down, quiet everybody
Got a long way to go
I told you once before
That you better not start the show

Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
Keep on, keep on, keep on, yeah

If you want me
You can't have me
Because you've got to
Understand me

Back off, baby I'm a loner
Got a lotta things to see
I told you once before
That you better not take it from me

Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
Keep on, keep on, keep on, yeah

If you hate this
No, I can't blame you
Because I'm hurtin'
So I'll flame you
I've seen this game before
My love walks right to your door
There ain't no hope for me anymore
Ah ha ha ha
Yeah


If you hate this
No, I can't blame you
Because I'm hurtin'
So I'll flame you
I've seen this game before
My love walks right to your door
There ain't no hope for me anymore
Ah ha ha ha
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
I'VE HAD IT UP TO HERE
Don't want to find myself homogenized
Don't want to become the very thing that I despised
Don't need my mommy feedin' me culture with a spoon
Don't want to end up with as much edge as a balloon
Don't want my ideas polluted by mediocrity
Don't want my sentiments diluted
This is important to me

I tried to give my best to you
But you plugged up your ears
And now I just can't take no more
I've had it up to here

Don't want to be another boy next door
Don't want to pander to the masses anymore
Don't need the whole wide world to love me
Don't want to win the human race
Don't want my music to be less well-known than my face
Don't want to compromise my art for universal appeal
Don't want to be mass consumed
I'm not a happy meal

I tried to give my best to you
But you plugged up your ears
And now I just can't take no more
I've had it up to here

I moved out from the sticks
Nobody believed in me
Had to climb my way up
Overcome all kinds of adversity
Oh, if you think I need approval
From a faceless throng, whoa
That's where you're wrong
So wrong

I tried to give my best to you
But you plugged up your ears
And now I just can't take no more
I've had it up to here

(I've had it
I've had it
I've had it)
I've had it up to here

I SWEAR IT'S TRUE
It's been two and a half years now that we've been apart
I've been kinda spaced out lately
Can't seem to get you out of my mind

I really miss you, girl
I really do
You think I'm crazy but I swear it's true

You think I'd have given up
Found somebody new
But no girl's got what you got
I belong to you

I really miss you, girl
I really do
You think I'm crazy but I swear it's true

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

I really miss you, girl
I really do
You think I'm crazy but I swear it's true

I swear it's true
I really do
I swear it's true
I swear it's true
GETCHOO
This is beginning to hurt
This is beginning to be serious
It used to be a game, now it's a crying shame
'Cause you don't wanna play around no more

Sometimes I push too hard
Sometimes you fall and skin your knee
I never meant to do all that I've done to you
Please, baby, say it's not too late

To getchoo, uh-huh
Getchoo, uh-huh
Getchoo, uh-huh
Getchoo, getchoo, getchoo
Uh-huh
Oh-ho

You know this is breaking me up
You think that I'm some kind of freak, uh-huh
But if you'd come back to me, then you would surely see
That I'm just fooling around

Getchoo, uh-huh
Getchoo, uh-huh
Getchoo, uh-huh
Getchoo, getchoo, getchoo

I can't believe (I can't believe)
What you've done to me
What I did to them (what I did to them)
You've done to me, oh

Getchoo, uh-huh
Getchoo, uh-huh
Getchoo, uh-huh
Getchoo, getchoo, getchoo
Uh-huh

(This is beginning to hurt) Oh-ho
(This is beginning to hurt) Oh-ho
(This is beginning to hurt) Oh-ho-ho-ho
(This is beginning to hurt) Oh
CALL THE POLICE
Like the stripe and some polka dots
Dirty jokes in the coffee shop
This is detestable
But when I see you you give me the sweetest smile
And it's bad when I call you in
To the office and borrow your pen
Some might say nefarious
But I know you really wanna see what I'm writing down
They're gonna call the police
They're gonna bring in the SWAT team
'Cuz we've been breaking the law
And we don't know how to stop
Maybe they'll understand that it's in the cards
And maybe they'll let us go if we try real hard
They're gonna call the police
They're gonna bring in the SWAT team
'Cuz we've been breaking the law
And we don't know how to stop
And we don't know how to stop
Got a job at the clinic
Where I tried to shoplift it
With the cook I'ma clean it
Criminal on the loose
They're gonna call the police
They're gonna bring in the SWAT team
'Cuz we've been breaking the law
And we don't know how to stop
They're gonna call the police
They're gonna bring in the SWAT team
'Cuz we've been breaking the law
And we don't know how to stop
They're gonna call the police
RAINBOW CONNECTION
Why are there so many songs about rainbows
And what's on the other side?
Rainbows are visions, but only illusions
And rainbows have nothing to hide
So we've been told and some choose to believe it
I know they're wrong, wait and see

Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers and me

Who said that every wish would be heard
And answered when wished on the morning star?
Somebody thought of that and someone believed it
Look what it's done so far
What's so amazing that keeps us star gazing
And what do we think we might see?

Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers and me

All of us under its spell
We know that it's probably magic
Have you been half asleep and have you heard voices?
I've heard them calling my name
Is this the sweet sound that called the young sailors?
The voice might be one and the same
I've heard it too many times to ignore it
It's something that I'm supposed to be

Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers and me

La da da di da da dum
La da da da dum di da do
QUEEN OF EARTH
Queen of Earth, won't you stand by my side
We've both waited, for the whole of our lives
Come with me, we can build ecstasy
Never once, have I felt quite this way
Feel my heartbeat is just slipping away
Want to live in my hole in the ground
I'm over and done, baby
I'm over and done
I never want to be alone
I never want to be alone
Want to live in my hole in the ground
I'm over and done, baby
I'm over and done
I never want to be alone
I never want to be alone
SLOB
Leave me alone
I won't pick up the phone
And I won't listen to messages
Sent by someone who calls up and says

"I don't like how you're living my life
Get yourself a wife
Get yourself a job
You're living a dream
Don't you be a slob!"

Leave me again
Don't hang out in my den
Waiting for little clues to appear
That I drank some of Granddaddy's beer

I don't like how you're living my life
Get yourself a wife
Get yourself a job
You're living a dream
Don't you be a slob
Slob
Slob


Waiting for little clues to appear
That I drank some of Granddaddy's beer

I don't like how you're living my life
Get yourself a wife
Get yourself a job
You're living a dream
Don't you be a slob
Slob
Slob
STARLIGHT
That's alright
That's Ok
I'll keep holding on today
'Cause I'm waiting for the starlight in your eyes
No more faith
No more hope
All that I can do is grope
For a shred of loving care from my girl
The pain you felt has burdened you
You can't feel loved
I'm glad that I have been with you
But that's not enough
In your arms I would be
Overjoyed as any boy
Holding on to what he loves
Oh so much
Feel your touch every night
When I dreamed to be alright
There you are in front of me
With your smile
The pain you felt has burdened you
You can't feel loved
I'm glad that I have been with you
But that's not enough
Whoa, that's not enough
The pain you felt has burdened you
You can't feel loved
I'm glad that I have been with you
But that's not enough
Whoa, that's not enough
In your arms I would be
Overjoyed as any boy
Holding on to what he loves
Oh so much
Holding on to what he loves
Oh so much
Holding on to what he loves
Oh so much
HAPPY TOGETHER
Imagine me and you, I do
I think about you day and night, it's only right
To think about the girl you love and hold her tight
So happy together
If I should call you up, invest a dime
And you say you belong to me, and ease my mind
Imagine how the world could be, so very fine
So happy together

I can't see me lovin' nobody but you
For all my life
When you're with me, baby the skies'll be blue
For all my life

Me and you, and you and me
No matter how they toss the dice, it had to be
The only one for me is you, and you for me
So happy together

I can't see me lovin' nobody but you
For all my life
When you're with me, baby the skies'll be blue
For all my life

Me and you and you and me
No matter how they toss the dice, it had to be
The only one for me is you, and you for me
So happy together

Ba-ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba-baa
Ba-ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba-baa

Me and you, and you and me
No matter how they toss the dice, it had to be
The only one for me is you, and you for me
So happy together

So happy together
How is the weather (Ba-ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba-ba)
So happy together (Ba-ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba-ba)
We're happy together (Ba-ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba-ba)
So happy together (Ba-ba-ba-ba ba-ba-ba-ba)
I'M JUST BEING HONEST
Walk into the venue, you slipped me your CD
Asked me if I'd listen, give you my critique
I listened to it, but halfway through it
I had to quit, your band sounds like shit

So, here we go
Don't get mad at me, I'm just being honest
I should have lied
Don't get mad at me, I'm just being honest

Walk into the bedroom, you were standing there
Turned around and smiled at me and said you just cut your hair
But then I told you I thought you looked better before
You said, "Hope you like sleeping on the floor"

So, here we go
Don't get mad at me, I'm just being honest
I should have lied
Now you're mad at me, I'm just being honest
How 'bout from now on you'll write the script, I'll read the lines
So, here we go
Don't get mad at me, I'm just being honest

And now I'm staring at her napkin
With seven digits that I can't make out
She wrote it down in purple lipstick
I shoulda never, I shoulda never opened up
And maybe it's because I'm Irish
I just couldn't keep my big mouth shut
Is that an eight, is that a zero?
I should have never, I should have never opened up

So, here we go
Don't get mad at me, I'm just being honest
I should have lied
Now you're mad at me, I'm just being honest
How 'bout from now on you'll write the script, I'll read the lines
So, here we go
Don't get mad at me, I'm just being honest (I'm just being honest)

Whoa-oh-oh (I'm just being honest)
Whoa-oh-oh (I'm just being honest)
PAPERFACE
Amy Moore blew her top
Stole a car, shot a cop
Sped away 2000 miles
Didn't stop until she hit New Orleans
But that's alright
There's just one thing
Her wedding ring, or anything
She left behind, forgot to pack
How the hell is she gonna get it back?
Paperface
Paperface
I never heard of paperface
Until I moves to the west coast
Where I found that to be smooth
I had to wear a paperface
That's alright
There's just one thing
How am I supposed to sing
With this thing in my way
With this thing...
In my face
Paperface
Paperface
Only hope to see
See what's underneath
Only hope to be
The me that's underneath
Amy Moore blew her top
Stole a car, shot a cop
Sped away 2000 miles
Didn't stop until she hit New Orleans
But that's alright
There's just one thing
Her wedding ring, or anything
She left behind, forgot to pack
How the hell is she gonna get it back?
Paperface, paperface, paperface, paperface!
Hup, hup 
I WANT TO BE SOMETHING
4 in the morning
And my roommate's still a-snoring
So I take a walk out on the Boulevard
The wind above me
Seems to push and pull and shove me
But it shows me all the places I could fly
I want to be something
Before I die
I feel it burning me inside
I want to be something
I don't know why
I want to know that at least I tried
I see so clearly
That the odds are stacked against me
And that nobody else believes in me at all
I'm all alone here
And I have to face my own fear
I have no choice but to keep on keeping on
I want to be something
Before I die
I feel it burning me inside, whoooooaaa-oh
I want to be something
I don't know why
I want to know that at least I tried
And if my dreams all come true someday, true someday
I won't forget how I feel today, I feel today
I'm blown away
I wanna be some'n'... x 7
Here I am, here I am
I want to be something
Before I die
I feel it burning me inside, whoooooaaa-oh
I want to be something
I want to feel something
I want to know that at least I tried
THE WORLD HAS TURNED AND LEFT ME HERE
The world has turned and left me here
Just where I was before you appeared
And in your place, an empty space
Has filled the void behind my face

I just made love with your sweet memory
One thousand times in my head
You said you loved it more than ever
You said

You remain, turned away
Turning further every day

The world has turned and left me here
Just where I was before you appeared
And in your place, an empty space
Has filled the void behind my face

I talked for hours to your wallet photograph
And you just listened
You laughed, enchanted by my intellect
Or maybe you didn't

You remain, turned away
Turning further every day

The world has turned and left me here
Just where I was before you appeared
And in your place, an empty space
Has filled the void behind my face


You remain, turned away
Turning further every day

The world has turned and left me here
Just where I was before you appeared
And in your place, an empty space
Has filled the void behind my face
(Do you believe what I sing now?)
The world has turned and left me here
(Do you believe what I sing now?)
Just where I was before you appeared
(Do you believe?)
And in your place, an empty space
Has filled the void behind my...

Do you believe what I sing now?
Do you believe what I sing now?
Do you believe?
BLOWIN' MY STACK
Woe is me
I'm standing in line for the first time in a mighty long time
But it feels good to be a jerk
I'm just a loser on his way to work
Because I need cash to pay my bills
And buy some groceries to eat my fill
But I'm pissed off cause no one cares
They walk on by me like I ain't ever there

So I'm blowing my stack
Blowing my stack
It makes me feel good
Blowing my stack
Blowing my stack
It makes me feel good

So easy to roll through life
You know the answers but you don’t know why
You just stand tall and move ahead
Your heart it beating but you wind up dead
Because you can't feel any love inside
It tries to find you but you run and hide
Because your so scared (so scared), so scared (so scared)
And I'm scared too

So I'm blowing my stack
Blowing my stack
It makes me feel good
Blowing my stack
Blowing my stack
It makes me feel good

I'm too tired to fight 
Fight, fight

So I'm blowing my stack
Blowing my stack
It makes me feel good
Blowing my stack
Blowing my stack
It makes me feel good
THE STORY OF MY LIFE
You and me don't hang together
All we say is, "pleasant weather"
Listen to me if you have the time
I'm all alone in the story of my life
Nobody cares if I live or I die
I thought that you should know
Some people never know
I hope you never go away
Don't be frightened, I am harmless
I just wanted to express this
You can get up and go if you like
I'm all alone in the story of me life
Nobody cares if I live or I die
I thought that you should know
Some people never know
I hope you never go away
I'm all alone in the story of my life
Nobody cares if I live or I die
I'm all alone in the story of my life
Nobody cares if I live or I die
I'm all alone
I'm all alone
I'm all alone
I'm all alone
WE GO TOGETHER
We go together
And that's to stay
And in the future
We'll always play
Looks like a big surprise
Hands up, it's in your eyes
We go together
And that's for sure
And in the future
We'll still be pure
Looks like a big surprise
Hands up, it's in your eyes
Here she comes again
Here she goes again
That's true
Looks like a big surprise
Hands up, it's in your eyes
Here she comes again
Here she goes again
That's true, oh
We go together
And that's to stay
And in the future
We'll always play
And in the future
We'll always play
THE DAMAGE IN YOUR HEART
One more time
I have crossed the line
Now you won't be mine
Anymore
One more dream
Vanished up in smoke
Now i have no hope
Anymore

Let it go
The damage in your heart
Let it go
The damage in your heart
I can't tell you how the words have made me feel
I can't tell you how the words have made me feel
One more tear
Falling down your face
Doesn't mean that much to the world
One more loss
In a losing life
Doesn't hurt so bad
Anymore


One more tear
Falling down your face
Doesn't mean that much to the world

I can't tell you
I can't tell you
I can't tell you
How the words have made me feel
MY BEST FRIEND
When everything is wrong I'll come talk to you
You make things alright when I'm feeling blue
You are such a blessing and I won't be messing
With the one thing that brings light to all of my darkness

You are my best friend
And I love you, and I love you
Yes I do

There is no other one that can take your place
I feel happy inside when I see your face
I hope you believe me
Because I speak sincerely
And I mean it when I tell you I need you

I'm here right beside you
I will never leave you
And I feel the pain you feel when you start crying
(*2)

Yes I do...
Yes I do
GET ME SOME
Right now everything sucks
I can't express the things I want
I got to play in this game
And you know dumb the house rules are
Someday I'm gonna break out of here
And I will find what is true in my soul (I won't let go)
I work my skin to the bone because I'm not gonna give up
I'm not gonna give up!
I've got to get me some
I've got to live my life
I've got a heart that beats
And nobody else has time
They ain't gonna keep me down
Cuz I've got to reach the top
I've got to get me some
I've got to have my rock
I've got to get me some now baby
I'll pose in the magazine
I'll be on the satellite TV
In Detroit Metal City
With 10,000 people just like me
They'll all be singing along
And the girls will show me their love (high up above)
I ain't never coming back
I be out with my brothers
I'm out with my brothers!
I've got to get me some
I've got to live my life
I've got a heart that beats
And nobody else has time
They ain't gonna keep me down
Cuz I've got to reach the top
I've got to get me some
I've got to have my rock
I've got to get me some now baby
I've got to get me some now baby
I've got to get me some
I've got to live my life
I've got a heart that beats
And nobody else has time
They ain't gonna keep me down
Cuz I've got to reach the top
I've got to get me some
I've got to have my rock
(GIRL WE GOT A) GOOD THING
Girl, we got a good thing
You know where this is heading (uh-huh)
Just a couple lovebirds
Happy to be singing (uh-huh)
Girl, we got a good thing
And I don't see this ending
Do you want to fly? Do you want to flee?
Do you want to get away with me?
Do you want to face the great unknown?

Jingle, jingle
We're as happy as a couple Hare Krishnas
Dancing, twirling, playing on the tambourine
We'll crush the scene together
Marching onward
Oblivious to all the hate around us
We can self-publish a book of our philosophy
And hand it to the tourists

Girl, we got a good thing
You know where this is heading (uh-huh)
Just a couple lovebirds
Happy to be singing (uh-huh)
Girl, we got a good thing
And I don't see this ending
Do you want to fly? Do you want to flee?
Do you want to get away with me?
Do you want to face the great unknown?

Puerto Rico
Would be perfect for a destination wedding
Or driving to Ventura on the 101
It sounds like fun, to me

You scare me like an open window
Let's chalk it up to Stockholm syndrome
I want to crawl in, crawl into a hole

Girl, we got a good thing
You know where this is heading (uh-huh)
Just a couple lovebirds
Happy to be singing (uh-huh)
Girl, we got a good thing
And I don't see this ending
Do you want to fly? Do you want to flee?
Do you want to get away with me?
Do you want to face the great unknown?
Girl, we got a good thing
Girl, we got a good thing
REPRESENT
US Soccer 2010 represent
I'm sick and tired of everybody trying to tell me what to do
If I'm in need of your advice then surely I would come to you
I didn't get in this position just by happenstance
I worked my bones beyond the limit just to have half a chance
It matters how you play the game
It matters that you can take the pain
You don't want to lie, steal, or cheat your way to the top
Ohh-ohh-ohhhhh
It matters what your people think
You represent your family
Well that's just one more reason to see
That it matters...
Whether you win or lose
Why don't we see who is the wizard and play some one on one
I think you'll find me sympathetic to ya when I've won
It seems you've got the brawn to beat me if this was all it takes
But I've got skills to pay the bills and punish each of your mistakes
It matters how you play the game
It matters that you can take the pain
You don't want to lie, steal, or cheat your way to the top
Ohh-ohh-ohhhhh
It matters what your people think
You represent your family
Well that's just one more reason to see
That it matters...
Whether you win or lose
One hundred years from now
They'll look back on this day
Where are you going to be
And what are they going to say
I see my name in lights
The people call my name
It's all up to you
Will you find a way?
It matters how you play the game
It matters that you can take the pain
You don't want to lie, steal, or cheat your way to the top
Ohh-ohh-ohhhhh
It matters what your people think
You represent your family
Well that's just one more reason to see
That it matters...
Whether you win or lose
It matters what your mother thinks
You represent your family
Well that's just one more reason to see
That it matters...
Whether you win or lose
LITTLE SONGS
Pill popping strangers
Downloading highs
Destroy the old God
Just pay the checks
Thank God a breath of life
Has come to make us right, right, right
Use any method
Break any law
Ignore the feelings
Just make it raw
We justify our acts
When we provoke a laugh, laugh, laugh
Time is swallowing
All these little songs we sing
We justify our acts
When we provoke a laugh, laugh, laugh
Time is swallowing
All these little songs we sing
Use any method
Break any law
Ignore the feelings
Just make it raw
Talk to our bodies
Say what you will
Without our numbers
Are we a pill?
Oooh, oooh-ohhh
HANG ON
Someday I'll be coming for you
You know what I'm wanting to do
I know the words to say
To draw you in so close to me

Over and over
We swore it was over
But just like wild clover
Love grows at light speed

Hang on until I see you again
I'm going to be more than a friend
You know that this isn't the end so hang on (hang on, hang on, hang on)

This was just a very first start
There's more that I hold in my heart
I'm waiting for a chance
To show you how I long to be

Over and over
We swore it was over
But just like I'm solar
You warm up to me

Hang on until I see you again
I'm going to be more than a friend
You know that this isn't the end so hang on (hang on, hang on, hang on)
Hang on until the break of the day
We'll cast all our troubles away
You know that this isn't the end so hang on (hang on, hang on, hang on)

Sweet thing
As long as I'm breathing
And my heart is still beating
I'm going to be coming for you

Hang on, hang on, hang on
Hang on, hang on, hang on


(Hang on) Hang on until I see you again
(Hang on) I'm going to be more than a friend
(Hang on) You know that this isn't the end so hang on
Hang on
WHY BOTHER?
I know I should get next to you
You got a look that makes me think you're cool
But it's just sexual attraction
Not somethin' real so I'd rather keep wackin'

Why bother? It's gonna hurt me
It's gonna kill when you desert me
This happened to me twice before
It won't happen to me anymore

I've known a lot of girls before
What's the harm in knowin' one more?
Maybe we could even get together
Maybe you could break my heart next summer

Why bother? It's gonna hurt me
It's gonna kill when you desert me
This happened to me twice before
It won't happen to me anymore


It's a crying shame I'm all alone
Not with you, nor her, nor anyone
Won't you knock me on my head?
Crack it open, let me outta here

Why bother? It's gonna hurt me
It's gonna kill when you desert me
This happened to me twice before
It won't happen to me anymore

(Why bother? It's gonna hurt me) Why bother? It's gonna hurt me
(It's gonna kill when you desert me) Why bother?
It's gonna hurt me
(Why bother? It's gonna hurt me) Why bother? It's gonna hurt me
Why bother? It's gonna hurt me
IN THE MALL
In the mall, in the fall
We're sneaking to the emergency hall
First we smoke then have a smoke
Get change for tokens and a pretzel and Coke
Now we're ready
In the mall, I was in the mall
Keep it steady
In the mall, I was in the mall
In the mall!
Holidays are on their way
These decorations have so much to say
Loses meaning, going west
Don't get facetious or you don't get the best
Bells are ringing
In the mall, I was in the mall
Now we're singing
In the mall, I was in the mall
I was in the mall! I was in the mall!
Take the elevator to the escalator
Ride it down and start again
All together
In the mall, I was in the mall
No place better
In the mall, I was in the mall
I was in the mall, in the mall!
SUMMER ELAINE AND DRUNK DORI
Oh, she left me there
She left me all alone
Oh, but I don't care
No I don't mind at all
What really happened?
I got distracted
I suck at getting off the phone
Boy in the bubble, saying "I love ya"
I should have written her a note

Summer Elaine and Drunk Dori
When I'm feelin' lonely, I don't want to go (oh oh, oh oh)
Summer Elaine and Drunk Dori
Wish that they would show me, I can't let them go (oh oh, oh oh)

Oh, she swam away
And flexed her mermaid tail
She was out too deep
When lightning struck the bay
Good witch or bad witch
God is a woman
I wish I hadn't played the prude
She touched my ankle
Paranoid Android
I felt it in my molecules

Summer Elaine and Drunk Dori
When I'm feelin' lonely, I don't want to go (oh oh, oh oh)
Summer Elaine and Drunk Dori
Wish that they would show me, I can't let them go (oh oh, oh oh)

Slender and tall
They whisked my worries away
Sweet piano melodies play
Feet crushing Sauvignon grapes
I hear them whispering, whispering, out at the pool
Remember when we were only sixteen
You made me believe in God
But when I finally wake
Both girls are gone


Summer Elaine and Drunk Dori
When I'm feelin' lonely, I don't want to go (oh oh, oh oh)
Summer Elaine and Drunk Dori
Wish that they would show me, I can't let them go (oh oh, oh oh)
OH NO THIS IS NOT FOR ME
Oh no this is not for me
I feel so empty
I feel remorse
I've got to leave you

No, don't go
You'll feel okay in the morning

But Maria, I'm red with shame
There's no one to blame but myself
I know what is right but I do what is wrong
I do what is wrong
AIN'T GOT NOBODY
I had another nightmare
Go back to sleep honey. Everything will be alright in the end.
I'm going to L.A
Uhhh...
All the girls are laughing at you
I'm proud of you, son
Rock is dead. Guitars are dead
In the "Where Are They Now" category: The Astronauts, with their first big hit "Ain't Got Nobody."
Ain't
Got
Nobody

Ain't got nobody
Ain't got nobody
Ain't got no one to really love me
Ain't got nobody
Ain't got nobody
Ain't got no one to kiss and hug me

I've been so patient
All around the nation
There ain't no one in all creation
I'm livin' all alone
Nobody at home
It's hard to fall asleep
I really start to freak
My daddy loved me
No one could touch me
Until he went up and left me lonely
That's human nature
We fail each other
And keep on searchin' for another

I thought I had a friend
But she was just pretend
She didn't have a soul
Nothing I could hold

Ain't got nobody
Ain't got nobody
Ain't got no one to really love me
Ain't got nobody
Ain't got nobody
Ain't got no one to kiss and hug me

Someone I could greet
When I come home from work
Someone who would smile
And take away the hurt
Ain't got nobody (ain't got nobody)
Ain't got nobody (ain't got nobody)
Could you be the one to really love me?
PUT ME BACK TOGETHER
One, Two, Three, Four

When I walk
Down the street
I been tripping on my feet
And my clothes
They don't match
And my blue jeans need a patch

It's cold outside
Is there someone there tonight?
It's cold outside
Would you let me come inside and make it right?

Here it's clear
That I'm not getting better
When I fall down
You put me back together

My hairdo isn't cool
And my lips are lined with drool
I'm a mess, since you left
You can use this fool, I'm a useless tool

It's cold outside
Is there someone there tonight?
It's cold outside
Would you let me come inside and make it right?

Here, it's clear
That I'm not getting better
When I fall down
You put me back together
I'm alone in my room
I don't know what to do
When I fall down
You put me back together

And when I day dream
We're eating ice cream
It's such a nice scene
But then I wake up crying
I know I just been lying

Right here, it's clear
That I'm not getting better (that I'm not getting better)
When I fall down, you put me back together (put me back together)
Here, it's clear
That I'm not getting better (that I'm not getting better)
When I fall down, you put me back together
I'm alone in my room, I don't know what to do
When I fall down you put me back together
THE DAWN
(Intro)
And as the day goes on
The world is holding on
Amuse yourself and I can't wait
I wake up with the dawn
And as the day goes on
The world is holding on
Amuse yourself and I can't wait
I wake up with the dawn
(Outro)
TRAMPOLINE
I've never seen you before
But I know what you're thinking
You've got a knife in your back
And your witches are sinking

Trampoline
You're on my mind

I've never seen you before
But I know what you're feeling
You're running under the ground
And you're hitting the ceiling


I've never seen you before
But I know what you're thinking
You've got a knife in your back
And your witches are sinking
Yes they're sinking
SO LOW
In your room
In your eyes
Silver spoon
Big surprise
In the darkest of days
I will love you some way
I need love
Babe I need love
And I want you to know, so low
In your eyes
In your days
And the room
Chips away
In the darkest of hours
I will lean in your power
I need love
Babe I need love
And I want you to
Take back the love you gave me baby
Sometimes you drive me crazy baby
This time I want you cryin' alone
Oh, so low
In the darkest of hours
I will lean in your power
I need love
Babe I need love
And I want you to
Take back the love you gave me baby
Sometimes you drive me crazy baby
This time I want you cryin' alone
Whoa, so low
PRIVATE MESSAGE
I want you
So badly
Too bad that
You slam me
And when you
Are reading
The words I
Write
You think that
I'm just some
Dumb horny guy
I'm trying
To show you
A hint of
My coolness
But I can't
Give up on
The secret deed
This love is
So empty
When you can't cheat
Hold my hand
Tell me that you love me
For who I am

But I can't
Give up on
The secret deed
Cause love is
So empty
When you can
Cheat
Hold my hand
Tell me that you love me
For who I am
I'm trying
To show you
A hint of
My coolness
REPRESENT (ROCKED OUT REMIX)
I'm sick and tired of everybody trying to tell me what to do
If I'm in need of your advice then surely I would come to you
I didn't get in this position just by happenstance
I worked my bones beyond the limit just to have half a chance
It matters how you play the game
It matters that you can take the pain
You don't want to lie, steal, or cheat your way to the top
Ohh-ohh-ohhhhh
It matters what your people think
You represent your family
Well that's just one more reason to see
That it matters...
Whether you win or lose
Why don't we see who is the wizard and play some one on one
I think you'll find me sympathetic to ya when I've won
It seems you've got the brawn to beat me if this was all it takes
But I've got skills to pay the bills and punish each of your mistakes
It matters how you play the game
It matters that you can take the pain
You don't want to lie, steal, or cheat your way to the top
Ohh-ohh-ohhhhh
It matters what your people think
You represent your family
Well that's just one more reason to see
That it matters...
Whether you win or lose
One hundred years from now
They'll look back on this day
Where are you going to be
And what are they going to say
I see my name in lights
The people call my name
It's all up to you
Will you find your way?
It matters how you play the game
It matters that you can take the pain
You don't want to lie, steal, or cheat your way to the top
Ohh-ohh-ohhhhh
It matters what your people think
You represent your family
Well that's just one more reason to see
That it matters...
Whether you win or lose
It matters what your mother thinks
You represent your family
Well that's just one more reason to see
That it matters...
Whether you win or lose
PERFECT SITUATION
What's the deal with my brain?
Why am I so obviously insane?
In a perfect situation
I let love down the drain
There's the pitch, slow and straight
All I have to do is swing
And I'm a hero, but I'm a zero

Hungry nights, once again
Now it's getting unbelievable
Cause I could not have it better
But I just can't get no play
From the girls, all around
As they search the night for someone to hold onto
And I just pass through...

Singing...
Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhhhhhhh
Singing...
Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhhhhhhh

Get your hands off the girl
Can't you see that she belongs to me?
And I don't appreciate this excess company
Though I can't satisfy all the needs she has
And so she starts to wander...
Can you blame her?

Singing...
Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhhhhhhh
Singing...
Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhhhhhhh

Tell me there's a logic out there
Leading me to better prepare
For the day that something really special might come
Tell me there's some hope for me
I don't wanna be lonely
For the rest of my days on the earth
Oh..!!

Singing...
Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhhhhhhh
Singing...
Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhh oh. Ooohhhhhhhhhh

Singing...
Ooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...
THE WEIGHT
I pulled in to Nazareth, was feeling 'bout half past dead
I just need some place where I can lay my head
"Hey mister, can you tell me where a man might find a bed?"
He just grinned and shook my hand, ``No'' was all he said
Take a load off, Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off, Fanny
And you put the load right on me
I picked up my bag, I went looking for a place to hide
When I saw Carmen and the Devil walking side by side
I said ``Hey Carmen, come on, let's go downtown''
She said ``I gotta go but my friend can stick around''
Go down Miss Moses, there's nothing you can say
It's just old Luke, and Luke's waiting on the judgement day
``Well, Luke my friend, what about young Anna-Lee?''
He said ``Do me a favour son, won't you stay and keep Anna-Lee company?''
Crazy Chester followed me and he caught me in the fog
He said ``I will fix your rat if you'll take Jack my dog''
I said ``Wait a minute Chester, you know I'm a peaceful man''
He said ``That's okay boy, won't you feed him when you can?''
Catch a cannonball now to take me down the line
My bag is sinking low and I do believe it's time
To get back to Miss Fanny, you know she's the only one
Who sent me here with her regards for everyone
AUTOMATIC
How am I going to
Deliver you a mountain size of love?
How do oceans connected by a straw
Get something through?
I might need some time to remember
Need some time to remember

Hey, It's automatic when you know it
Hey, It's automatic when feel it

When do I lay down
And get to see the world inside your eyes?
How can I reach out
And hold on to the joy you've got inside?


I got some
But I wanna feel it every hour
Cause I want to give it you
MEMORIES
Pissing in plastic cups before we went on stage
Playing hackey sack back when Audioslave was still Rage
Watching all the freaky Dutch kids vomit then have sex
Listening to techno music on the bus while we earned our checks

Memories make me want to go back there, back there
All the memories make me want to go back there, back there
All the memories, how can we make it back there, back there
I want to be there again

Messing with the journalists and telling stupid lies
They had a feeling that something was up
Because of the look in our eyes
In fact we didn't know what we were doing half of the time
We were so sure of ourselves and sure of our way through life

Memories make me want to go back there, back there
All the memories make me want to go back there, back there
All the memories, how can we make it back there, back there
I want to be there again

Now I got so many people that I got to look out for
Never know when I'll become awake and buy some food at the store
I can hear them babies crying and the lawn needs to be mowed
I got to get my groove on because I'm freaking bored!

Memories make me want to go back there, back there
All the memories make me want to go back there, back there
All the memories, how can we make it back there, back there
I want to be there again
I'M YOUR DADDY
I thought tonight would suck like every other night
I'd party with my friends
But when I saw you grooving on the dance floor
Normal came to an end
We started talking and man, it was so clear to me
There's no one else like you
You got the brains, the body, and the beauty
To top it off, you're cool

This ain't impossible
This ain't improbable
You are my baby tonight
And I'm your daddy
This ain't believable
This ain't predictable
You are my baby tonight
And I'm your daddy

I hope that I ain't freaking you out
You probably hear it all the time
I swear I ain't like those other boys
I'm a special kind
I would like to give a demonstration
Of what it is I do
I'll take you out to dinner at Palermo's
We'll split a cheese fondue

This ain't impossible
This ain't improbable
You are my baby tonight
And I'm your daddy
This ain't believable
This ain't predictable
You are my baby tonight
And I'm your daddy

I will ape the goomba
If you tire
Try my best to moonwalk
On the wire
I just want to, ooh ah
Feel your fire
Feel your fire
Feel your fire!

This ain't impossible
This ain't improbable
You are my baby tonight
And I'm your daddy
This ain't believable
This ain't predictable
You are my baby tonight
And I'm your daddy
IN THE GARAGE
I've got a Dungeon Master's Guide
I've got a 12-sided die
I've got Kitty Pryde
And Nightcrawler too
Waiting there for me
Yes I do, I do
I've got posters on the wall
My favorite rock group KISS
I've got Ace Frehley
I've got Peter Criss
Waiting there for me
Yes I do, I do

In the garage, I feel safe
No one cares about my ways
In the garage, where I belong
No one hears me sing this song
In the garage

I've got electric guitar
I play my stupid songs
I write these stupid words
And I love every one
Waiting there for me
Yes I do, I do

In the garage, I feel safe
No one cares about my ways
In the garage, where I belong
No one hears me sing this song
In the garage
In the garage


In the garage, I feel safe
No one cares about my ways
In the garage, where I belong
No one hears me sing this song

In the garage, I feel safe
No one laughs about my ways
In the garage, where I belong
No one hears me
No one hears me
No one hears me
No one hears me
No one hears me sing this song
THE PRINCE WHO WANTED EVERYTHING
Do do do do
Do do do do
Do do do do
Do do do do

Once upon a time, there was a prince
He tried to save the world with funk rock riffs
Look at him now, oh
Look at him now, oh
On cobblestones

He's the prince who wanted everything
He's the prince who wanted everything

Do do do do
Do do do do

Ooh, his hair was very Joan Baez
And fans would auction off his autographs
Look at him now, oh
Look at him now, oh
His paisley bones

He's the prince who wanted everything
He's the prince who wanted everything

Do do do do
She do do do

Because life will make a beggar of rich men
Bring the sovereign to his knees
And all the gold and all of the platinum
Melting like a chocolate sea
The only way to escape
Is to dance, dance, dance in the flames

Do do do do
Do do do do

All the courtiers would genuflect
Kiss the ring, secure a bonus check
Where are they now, oh?
Where are they now, oh?
In red Corvettes

They left the prince who wanted everything
He's the prince who wanted everything

Do do do do
DECEMBER
Only love can ease the pain
Of a boy caught in the rain
Only hope will remember
Burning flame in December

Only love
Only love

Only faith can bring to life
One who falls by the wayside
Only trust can inspire
Soggy lungs to breathe fire

Only love
Only love

It's only natural
The moon is just half full
We give our best away
We give our best away

Only love


Only trust can inspire
Soggy lungs to breathe fire

Only love
Only love
Only love
Only love
BEVERLY HILLS
Where I come from isn't all that great
My automobile is a piece of crap
My fashion sense is a little whack
And my friends are just as screwy as me
I didn't go to boarding schools
Preppie girls never looked at me
Why should they?
I ain't nobody
Got nothing in my pocket

Beverly Hills
That's where I want to be (gimme, gimme)
Livin' in Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills
Rollin' like a celebrity (gimme, gimme)
Livin' in Beverly Hills

Look at all those movie stars
They're all so beautiful and clean
When the housemaids scrub the floors
They get the spaces in between
I wanna live a life like that
I wanna be just like a king
Take my picture by the pool
Cause I'm the next big thing

Beverly Hills
That's where I want to be (gimme, gimme)
Livin' in Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills
Rollin' like a celebrity (gimme, gimme)
Livin' in Beverly Hills

The truth is I don't stand a chance
It's something that you're born into
And I just don't belong

No I don't
I'm just a no class, beat down fool
And I will always be that way
I might as well enjoy my life
And watch the stars play

Beverly Hills
That's where I want to be (gimme, gimme)
Livin' in Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills
Rollin' like a celebrity (gimme, gimme)
Livin' in Beverly Hills

Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills

TRAGIC GIRL
When you kiss me and say you love me
It makes me feel so good
I wanna break down and give in to you
I wanna believe that you're the one
You gimme my pills and sing this strange song
And all my hurting goes away
I start to drift off with you beside me
I wanna believe that you're the one

Cry and cry and let it out
We have to face that it's over now
Even as I anoint your door
I'm looking out for something more
Cry and cry, I'm crying too
'Cause no one touches me like you do
I don't want my mom to know that I've been a dirty boy

I try my darnedest to be a bastard
I want you to think that I don't care
But I feel sorry, and you're so pretty
You start to cry, and I kiss your mouth

Cry and cry and let it out
We have to face that it's over now
Even as I anoint your door
I'm looking out for something more
Cry and cry, I'm crying too
'Cause no one touches me like you do
I don't want my mom to know that I've been a dirty boy

You're a tragic girl, you lead a tragic life
I'm just meant to be your latest tragedy
Ain't no butterfly girl, this ain't no butterfly love
I'm just meant to be your latest tragedy

I try my darnedest to be a bastard
I want you to think that I don't care
But you're so pretty, and I feel sorry
I start to cry, and I kiss your mouth

I don't want my mom to know that I've been a dirty boy
You're a tragic girl, you lead a tragic life
I'm just meant to be your latest tragedy
This ain't no butterfly girl, this ain't no butterfly love
I'm gonna have to be your latest tragedy
I LOVE THE USA
Ain't that bad a place

Still got bills to pay
You sure know what to say
I'll put you in your place
Land of the free, I'm on my way

I love the USA
I love the USA
Fuck yeah, this place is great
I love the USA

Stop at coffee bean
This is like a dream
Let's run across the beach
Mama, what's the deal?
Nothin's wrong with me
Still waters running deep
Home of the brave, dog on a leash

I love the USA
I love the USA
Fuck yeah, this place is great
I love the USA

And God save the king

Won't feel a thing

Planes up in the sky
There's a missing man
A boy who didn't make it
DOPE NOSE
Hohhh
Aah-ah ohhh, Aah-ah ohhh
Ohh ohh ohh

Debt on my head
Wasting time, on my own
Sleep, rescue me
Take me back to my home
(Lord, take me home)

For the times that you wanna go
And bust rhymes real slow
I'll appear, slap you on the face
And enjoy the show

Hohhh
Aah-ah ohhh, Aah-ah ohhh
Ohh ohh ohh

Cheese smells so good
On a burnt piece of lamb (Piece of what?)
Fag of the year
Who could beat up your man

For the times that you wanna go
And bust rhymes real slow
I'll appear, slap you on the face
And enjoy the show
Ohhhhhh, this dope nose

Aah-ah ohhh, Aah-ah ohhh
Ohh ohh ohh

PREACHER'S SON
I can't help it girl, I'm the preacher's son
I must live for peace till the day is done
But I will never let you go
Once I have got you in my hold
I'm gonna mold ya into something that I like
I can't change my ways, I'm a puppet's fool
If you need a fix, then I'll be your tool

WHAT IS THIS I FIND?
What is this I find
Under your behind
Extra huge and it's used
I wonder which two of us best of friends opened then used it

Jonas, you know I waited  (Oh, I threw away your)
Waited till I couldn't take it (loving. I guess I took you for)
I was alone (gran-)
He called on the phone (-ted. I'm)
And gave me the love you wouldn't (all alone)

Only one I know (Think of the times we had)
Who fits is our Dondo (Think of the times we had)
Extra huge and it's used (Love would come true if I could undo
I know which two of us best of friends opened then used it (What you, you made me do.)
ACROSS THE SEA
You are eighteen year-old girl
Who live in small city of Japan
You heard me on the radio
About one year ago and you wanted to know
All about me and my hobbies
My favorite food and my birthday

Why are you so far away from me?
I need help and you're way across the sea
I could never touch you
I think it would be wrong
I've got your letter
You've got my song

They don't make stationery like this where I'm from
So fragile, so refined
So I sniff and I lick your envelope
And fall to little pieces every time
I wonder what clothes you wear to school
I wonder how you decorate your room
I wonder how you touch yourself
And curse myself for being across the sea

Why are you so far away from me?
I need help and you're way across the sea
I could never touch you
I think it would be wrong
I've got your letter
You've got my song


At 10, I shaved my head and tried to be a monk
I thought the older women would like me if I did
You see, ma, I'm a good little boy (good little boy)
It's all your fault, momma, it's all your fault!

Goddamn, this business is really lame
I gotta live on an island to find the juice
So you send me your love from all around the world
As if I could live on
Words and dreams and a million screams
Oh, how I need a hand in mine to feel...

Why are you so far away from me?
Why are you so far away from me?
I could never touch you
I think it would be wrong
I've got your letter
You've got my song

(I've got your letter) I've got your letter
You've got my song
ALL MY FRIENDS ARE INSECTS
I have a friend and it's an earthworm
It burrows underground deep within the soil
Sometimes when it rains it comes out
And we talk about our day
I have a friend and she's a butterfly
She flies from flower to flower drinking sweet nectar
With hundreds of friends
They sleep up in the trees at night
I have a friend and he's a dragonfly
He sweeps around all day and hovers in the air
He's colorful and wonderful
His wings are strong and powerful
He's the dragonfly
These are my friends
Even though they are bugs
They have a big role in our world
Even though they're bugs
I have a friend and it's an earthworm
I have a friend and she's a butterfly
I have a friend and he's a dragonfly
They are my friends and yeah they're all insects
THE ANGEL AND THE ONE
It's not my destiny to be the one that you will lay with
So many reasons why I have to go but want to stay here
Sometimes I want a taste
But then I don't know what I'm saying

You are the angel
And I am the one that is praying

There is another love
That I would rather be obeying
I see the ecstasy
And already I'm anticipating

I feel a deeper peace
And that deeper peace is penetrating
I got the magic in me
I am complete is what I'm saying

I'm flying up so high
My purple majesty displaying
I've reached a higher place
That no one else can make a claim in

I'll take you there, my friend
I'm reaching out my hand, so take it
We are the angels
And we are the ones that are praying

Peace, shalom
Peace, shalom
Peace, peace
Peace, shalom
Peace, shalom
Peace, peace
Peace, shalom
Peace, shalom
Peace, peace
Peace, shalom
Peace, shalom
Peace, peace
MEXICAN FENDER
Met her at a guitar shop on Santa Monica and 7th Street
The salesman tried to get my attention to sell me a Mexican Fender
She came to get her 10,000 steps and hang out with her boyfriend
But I was only trying to get to know her so I took her out to the ocean
It was hot, hot, 100 degrees 
But she only went in up to her knees
She didn't want to take off her jeans 'cause that would be insane

My summer love, oo-we-oo
My summer love, oo-we-oo
Oh she loves me, she loves me, she loves me not
Oh she loves me, she loves me, she loves me not

She got a bachelor's degree in physics and a job in computer programming
That's pretty cool for a singer in a band so I knew we would end up jamming
Later that night we went to a gig and she asked for some advice
"What do you do with your hands when you're singing, do you just hold onto the mic?"
It was hot, hot, 100 degrees 
And the trash overflowed out on the street
The heartbreak DJ stepped to me but I just couldn't get enough 

Of my summer love, oo-we-oo
My summer love, oo-we-oo
Oh she loves me, she loves me, she loves me not
Oh she loves me, she loves me, she loves me not

Gonna fly so high
To a place that we have never seen
Ever since you came 'round
In a greasy tee and faded jeans, woah
I got a cozy pad around the corner
Slide a little closer

My summer love, oo-we-oo
My summer love, oo-we-oo
Oh she loves me, she loves me, she loves me not
Oh she loves me, she loves me, she loves me not
Oh she loves me, she loves me, she loves me not
Oh she loves me, she loves me, she loves me not
I JUST THREW OUT THE LOVE OF MY DREAMS
I'm so tall, can't get over me
I'm so low, can't get under me
I must be all these things
For I just threw out the love of my dreams

He's in my eyes, he is in my ears
He's in my blood, he is in my tears
I breathe love and see him every day
Even though my love is a world away

Oh, he's got me wondering
My righteousness is crumbling

Never before have I felt this way
I know what is right, but want for him to stay
I must be made of steel
For I just threw out the love of my dreams

He's in my eyes, he is in my ears
He's in my blood, he is in my tears
I breathe love and see him every day
Even though my love is a world away

Oh, he's got me wondering
My righteousness is crumbling


Oh, he's got me wondering
My righteousness is crumbling
And I see him every day
Even though my love's a world away

He's in my eyes, he is in my ears
He's in my blood, he is in my tears
I must be made of steel
For I just threw out the love of my dreams
HOW LONG?
Two plus two
Me and you
Strolling down the avenue
I never knew that this was meant to be
And all the times we looked into each others eyes
I did it again, I did it again, I did it for you
Holding on
To a song
I guess it's time we passed it on
'Cause one of us keeps changing every day
And all the times we told each other little lies
I did it again, I did it again, I did it for you
How long before we learn to let love fly away?
How long before we learn to live another day?
Whoa-oa
And all the times we broke our hearts to spite ourselves
I did it again, I did it again, I did it for you
How long before we learn to let love fly away?
How long before we learn to live another day?
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
You and me
BUDDY HOLLY
What's with these homies dissin' my girl?
Why do they gotta front?
What did we ever do to these guys
That made them so violent?

Woo-hoo, but you know I'm yours
Woo-hoo, and I know you're mine
Woo-hoo, and that's for all time

Woo-ee-ooh, I look just like Buddy Holly
Oh-oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore
I don't care what they say about us anyway
I don't care 'bout that

Don't you ever fear, I'm always near
I know that you need help
Your tongue is twisted, your eyes are slit
You need a guardian

Woo-hoo, and you know I'm yours
Woo-hoo, and I know you're mine
Woo-hoo, and that's for all time

Woo-ee-ooh, I look just like Buddy Holly
Oh-oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore
I don't care what they say about us anyway
I don't care 'bout that
I don't care 'bout that

Bang! Bang!
Knock on the door
Another big bang, get down on the floor
Oh no! What do we do?
Don't look now but I lost my shoe
I can't run and I can't kick
What's a matter, babe, are you feelin' sick?
What's a matter, what's a matter, what's a matter you?
What's a matter, babe, are you feelin' blue? Oh-oh!
(And that's for all time
And that's for all time)

Woo-ee-oo, I look just like Buddy Holly
Oh-oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore
I don't care what they say about us anyway
I don't care 'bout that
I don't care 'bout that
I don't care 'bout that
I don't care 'bout that
THE OTHER WAY
I want to help you
But I don't know how
I want to soothe you
But i can't speak out

I have many fears about rejection
I have many memories of pain
I have always been a little shy
So i'll turn and look the other way

Other way
Other way
I will turn and look the other way

I want to hold you
But i am afraid
I want to touch you
But i'm not that way

I have many doubts about my motives
I have many fears about my greed
I have always hurt the one that i love
So i'll turn and look the other way


 x3

The Other way (Other way)
The Other way (Other way)
The Other way (Other way)
The Other way (Other way)
O GIRLFRIEND
I miss you
And I wonder how you feel about me too
Do you miss the way we would play
And waste our time away?
Suddenly, we're apart
And I can't see you every night
Though we'd fight I loved you so much
Now, I can't feel your touch

Oh, girlfriend
That's the end
And I'm lost without your love
Oh, love

In your arms
I was happy as a little boy could be
Taking pills and mellowing out
Now, I just want to shout
For your love
'Cause I'm drifting further from you every day
Driving by your place every night
I used to feel alright

Oh, girlfriend
That's the end
And I'm lost without your love
Oh, love

Feeling fancies every night
When I dreamed to be alright
Oh, love
Oh, love

Oh, girlfriend
That's the end
And I'm lost without your love
Oh, love

In your arms
I was happy as a little boy could be
Taking pills and mellowing out
Now, I just want to shout
Now, I just want to shout
Now, I just want to shout
ENDLESS BUMMER
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey

I just want this summer to end
What's the point of trying to pretend?
She told me to follow the rules
Not all 19 year olds are cool
I'm all alone at night
Dreamin' about my life
She was too fast for me
I count my steps because I'm OCD
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey

No life from Paloma to Rose
Sometimes I feel like I'm a ghost
Changing into street clothes in a tent
I just want this summer to end (summer to end)
My heart is so landlocked
Nothing but tourist shops
It's just like a curse, you see
This bummed out feeling that she's over me
She's over me

I put my jacket over my head
I'm trying not to stare at her chest
I can't even dance in the dark
Cause my headphones are still on the seat of her car
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey

Kumbaya makes me get violent
I just want this summer to end
Whoa
BEACH BOYS
Heard that before
Uh

The sun won't shine tonight
Metro screaming by
Walking with the Mexicans
Should I call an ambulance?
We need a melody
A gorgeous four part harmony
So it all makes sense
There's gotta be more than this
Everyone wants to be cooler than everyone else
It's a hip hop world
And we're the furniture
Let's get out of the city
Let me tell you about a band I loved
When I was a west-side kid, mmm

Turn it up
It's the Beach Boys
Singing out in a sweet voice
On a roll like a twist toy
Keep cranking them Beach Boys
Turn it up
It's the Beach Boys
Making my eyes get moist
Hold 'em up at gunpoint
Keep cranking them Beach Boys

Whatcha wanna do tonight?
I'll make it all happen
Mixing up OJ
And champagne
Cooler than the ice capades

We need a leader someone to tell us what to do
To raise the bar
To make it rain
We're gonna go caroling in Ocean Park
If you know the notes sing from your heart
'Cause it's gonna be fun
I'm a remarkable guy
I keep you trying new things
I keep you young

Turn it up
It's the Beach Boys
Singing out in a sweet voice
On a roll like a twist toy
Keep cranking them Beach Boys
Turn it up
It's the Beach Boys
Making my eyes get moist
Hold 'em up at gunpoint
Keep cranking them Beach Boys

They'll be there when you wake up
You're soothing midnight mantra (turn it up)

It's the Beach Boys
Making my eyes get moist
Hold em up at gunpoint

I've heard that before
But I want to hear it again (I wanna hear it over and over again)
I've heard that before
But I want to hear it over and over again (I wanna hear it over and over again)

Fellas, I have 3000 words to say
Quit screaming and start singing from your hearts, huh?

Turn it up
It's the Beach Boys
Singing out in a sweet voice
On a roll like a Rolls Royce
Keep cranking them Beach boys
Turn it up
It's the Beach Boys
Making my eyes get moist
Hold 'em up at gunpoint
Keep cranking them Beach Boys

They'll be there when you wake up
Your soothing midnight mantra (turn it up)

It's the Beach Boys
Making my eyes get moist
Hold 'em up at gunpoint
Keep cranking them Beach Boys

We don't have a blend
Can we have a chord? Just a chord? Like we used to when you had clear records okay?
Lets go, lets go, lets go
PHOTOGRAPH
If you want it, you can have it
But you've got to learn to reach out there and grab it
'Cause everybody wants some love (oh, baby)
Shooting from the stars above (oh, baby)
And though my heart will break
There's more that I could take
I could never get enough

If you need it, you should show it
Because you might play so monastic that you blow it
'Cause everybody wants some hope
Something they can barely know
And though my heart will break
There's more that I could take
I could never let it go

It's in the photograph
It's in the photograph
It's in the photograph of love

'Cause everybody wants a dream
Something they can barely see
And though my heart will break
There's more that I could take
I could never let it be

It's in the photograph
It's in the photograph
It's in the photograph of love

If you blew it, don't reject it
Just sit, drawing up the plans and re-erect it
Just sit, drawing up the plans and re-erect it
Just sit, drawing up the plans and re-erect it
AIN'T GOT MUCH TIME
You said you'd never love me
I said you'd never try
I can't believe this world is gonna die
And why can't you get me on the line?
I swear to you I ain't got much time
You said you'd never need me
I said you'd never care
I can't believe this world is gonna end
And why can't you get me on the line?
I swear to you I ain't got much time
Oh, oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh oh
And why can't you get me on the line?
I swear to you I ain't got much time
Oh, oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh oh
LISTEN UP
Listen, pretty mama
I want to be with you tonight, oh yeah
I know you left me
For someone younger than I, oh yeah
Listen up for goodness sakes
Me, I've never have much breaks
Opened up my heart and then they all just let me down
Whoa, down
Listen, sweet baby, yeah
I know it's too late to 'xplain, oh yeah
Why I can't please you
I got you when I was sane, yeah
Listen up for goodness sakes
Me, I've never have much breaks
Opened up my heart and then they all just let me down
Whoa, down
And the love you gave to me
Will increase my will to be, be... down, yeah
Listen up for goodness sakes
Me, I've never have much breaks
Opened up my heart and then they all just let me down
Whoa, down
And the love you bring to me
Will increase my will to be, be... down, yeah yeah
Down, yeah
Down, yeah
EVERYBODY NEEDS SALVATION
Meet me in the dark, my heart
Shrivels when the light is shining
I can't get back home, alone
I need someone here to guide me
Praise for the awakened one
He truly saved my life
But after all his truth is small
And I love the lie

Everybody needs salvation
And if it doesn't come we make some
Some people can get by on nothing
But I still need to know I'm something

Just like in a dream, I scream
And no one hears the words I'm saying
Have I lost my mind, this time?
Or have I won the game we're playing?
That's all I really care about
It's kind of wonderful
Kiss me while we both are still intangible

Everybody needs salvation
And if it doesn't come we make some
Some people can get by on nothing
But I still need to know I'm something
Yes I still need to know I'm something

Ready to love you
Ready to give my heart
Ready to trust you
Cause I ain't afraid of the dark
I'm ready to love you
I'm ready to give my heart
I'm ready to trust you
Cause I ain't afraid, I ain't afraid of the dark!

Everybody needs salvation
And if it doesn't come we make some
Some people can get by on nothing
But I still need to know I'm something
TAKE CONTROL
Leave me now
Show me how
And I won't be ashamed of the things we once made
And I won't be comin' back 'round here no more, no

Leave and try
Tell me why
And I won't let you down
Drag your name all over town
And I won't be comin' back 'round here no more

Yo, everyone, everyone
Everyone I know (everyone I know)
Take control


And I won't let you down, drag your name all over town
And I won't be comin' back 'round here no more

Yo, everyone, everyone
Everyone I know (everyone I know)
Take control
Whoa hoooo
Whoa hoooo
Whoa hoooo
THOUGHT I KNEW
Sorry about my past life
Sorry but we just missed
Sorry it had to end up like this
Sorry if I caused you pain
Sorry I forgot your name
Sorry, but you left me out in the rain

Thought I knew you better then
Thought I knew your intentions
Thought I knew but didn't have a clue
Not a single damn thing was true

Sorry if I caused you harm
Sorry I'm no good luck charm
Sorry you didn't end up in my arms

Thought I knew you better then
Thought I knew your intentions
Thought I knew but didn't have a clue
Not a single damn thing was true

Now that our world's gone dark
We've drained the well, blew out the spark
And now we're left with broken hearts
Trying to find a new place to start

Thought I knew you better then
Thought I knew your intentions
Thought I knew but didn't have a clue
Not a single damn thing was true
Thought I knew you better then
Thought I knew your intentions
Thought I knew but didn't have a clue
Not a single damn thing was true
FRIEND OF A FRIEND
I'm just a friend of a friend
And I'd like to get to know you too
And see what you are going through
I'm not just after sex
I want to bask in the delight that is your womanhood
And call your name, Alice

I read the program by the light on my phone
But all I could think about was being with you alone yeah, yeah
And all the players in the orchestra pit were playing perfectly fine
But I just didn't get it yeah, yeah

Then you dropped your flowers on the ground
Some day I know that you will come around
No hate, I know it is what it is
Deep down, I know you're just a friend of a friend

I'm just a friend of a friend
And I'd like to be all over you
Sometimes it's hard to know what I should do
Sweetheart of Sigma Chi
You make me wish I was a Catholic
With only just a year or two to live

I read the program by the light on my phone
But all I could think about was being with you alone yeah, yeah
And all the players in the orchestra pit were playing perfectly fine
But I just didn't get it yeah, yeah

Then you dropped your flowers on the ground
Some day I know that you will come around
No hate, I know it is what it is
Deep down, I know you're just a friend of a friend


I read the program by the light on my phone
But all I could think about was being with you alone yeah, yeah
And all the players in the orchestra pit were playing perfectly fine
But I just didn't get it yeah, yeah

Then you dropped your flowers on the ground
Some day I know that you will come around
No hate, I know it is what it is
Deep down, I know you're just a friend of a friend
THE ODD COUPLE
I got a PC, you got a Mac
I'm giving you flak for your AirPort
I read books and you watch TV
You wanna be free to relax more
But when I think about the other people I could see
Nobody else out there could ever make me happy
I wonder how we came to be

The odd couple is what we are in reality
But we are so happy in everything we do
The odd couple is what they're saying of you and me
But we know the feeling that we share is true

Sometimes I want to strangle your neck
Or write you a check to get going
There's only so much more I can take
I made a mistake without knowing
But when I think about the way your little heart beats
When I am holding you and you are holding onto me
I wonder how we came to be


I hope you know that I don't mean you disrespect
I'm just pointing out, although the facts I double-checked
Everyone can see that we ain't two peas in a pod
But maybe that's our chemistry that takes us to the top
I think it's working baby, that's the point I'm trying to make
If I said something else to you then I would be a fake
I wonder how we came to be 


The odd couple 
Yeah, yeah 
ONLY IN DREAMS
You can't resist her
She's in your bones
She is your marrow
And your ride home
You can't avoid her
She's in the air (in the air)
In between molecules of
Oxygen and carbon dioxide

Only in dreams
We see what it means
Reach out our hands
Hold onto hers
But when we wake
It's all been erased
And so it seems
Only in dreams

You walk up to her
Ask her to dance
She says, "Hey, baby
I just might take the chance"
You say, "It's a good thing
That you float in the air (in the air)
That way there's no way I will crush
Your pretty toenails into a thousand pieces"

Only in dreams
We see what it means
Reach out our hands
Hold onto hers
But when we wake
It's all been erased
And so it seems
Only in dreams

Only in dreams
Only in dreams
Only in dreams
Only in dreams
Only in dreams
Only in dreams
VIVA LA VIDA
I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listened as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead long live the king
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
Missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world
It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know St Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
Hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know St Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
LA MANCHA SCREWJOB
I've been alone, so many times before
Times a-wastin', times a-wastin'
Singing songs behind a bolted door
Times a-wastin', times a-wastin'
And now the clock keeps ticking on
It's like my own private time bomb
But then you came along
And now we're famous

You and I, we do it right
Hanging out on a summer night
We've come so far, we shine so bright
Hanging out on a summer night
We're getting stronger, stronger, going faster, faster
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh; whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
You and I, we do it right
Hanging out on a summer night, yeah

I screwed it up so many times before
I'm like a hoodlum, like a hoodlum
But when you're near I wanna stop the war
And be a porch bum, be a porch bum
I guess I want to apologize
As I looked you in the eyes
We'll break through to the other side
And that's a promise

You and I, we do it right
Hanging out on a summer night
We've come so far, we shine so bright
Hanging out on a summer night
We're getting stronger, stronger, going faster, faster
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh; whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
You and I, we do it right
Hanging out on a summer night, yeah

I love life with you
With you
I love life with you
With you
I'm an early riser
Since the day I met you
And I love life with you
With you

You and I, we do it right
Hanging out on a summer night
We've come so far, we shine so bright
Hanging out on a summer night
We're getting stronger, stronger, going faster, faster
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh; whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
You and I, we do it right
Hanging out on a summer night, yeah
MY NAME IS JONAS
My name is Jonas
I'm carrying the wheel
Thanks for all you've shown us
But this is how we feel
Come sit next to me
Pour yourself some tea
Just like Grandma made
When we couldn't find sleep
Things were better then
Once but never again
We've all left the den
Let me tell you about it

The choo-choo train left right on time
A ticket cost only your mind
The driver said, "Hey man, we go all the way"
Of course we were willing to pay

My name is Wepeel
I got a box full of your toys
They're fresh out of batteries
But they're still making noise, making noise
Tell me what to do
Now the tank is dry
Now this wheel is flat
And you know what else
Guess what I received
In the mail today
Words of deep concern
From my little brother

The building's not going as he planned
The foreman has injured his hand
The dozer will not clear a path
The driver swears he learned his math

The workers are going home
The workers are going home
The workers are going home
The workers are going home
Yeah


The workers are going home
The workers are going home
The workers are going home
Yeah, yeah, yeah


My name is Jonas
COME TO MY POD
Come to my pod
There's no one there
We'll be alone
We can talk
And if you want to we'll get stoned
And relax...
Have fun...
In my pod

In your pod
No one knows the things we do
We'll get high
If you want to we'll sniff glue
And relax...
Have fun...
In your pod

In my/your pod
There's no one there
We'll be alone
We can talk
And make love the whole night through
And relax...
Have fun...
In my/your pod

Now that we're left all alone
Touch me and kiss me and love me
PINK TRIANGLE
When I'm stable long enough
I start to look around for love
See a sweet in floral prints
My mind begins the arrangements
But when I start to feel that pull
Turns out I just pulled myself
She would never go with me
Were I the last girl on earth

I'm dumb, she's a lesbian
I thought I had found the one
We were good as married in my mind
But married in my mind's no good
Oh, pink triangle on her sleeve
Let me know the truth
Let me know the truth

Might have smoked a few in my time
But never thought it was a crime
Knew the day would surely come
When I'd chill and settle down
When I think I've found a good old-fashioned girl
Then she put me in my place
Everyone's a little queer
Oh, can't she be a little straight?

I'm dumb, she's a lesbian
I thought I had found the one
We were good as married in my mind
But married in my mind's no good
Oh, pink triangle on her sleeve
Let me know the truth
Let me know the truth


I'm dumb, she's a lesbian
I thought I had found the one
We were good as married in my mind
But married in my mind's no good
Pink triangle on her sleeve
Let me know the truth
Let me know the truth

I'm dumb, she's a lesbian
I thought I had found the one
We were good as married in my mind
But married in my mind's no good
Pink triangle on her sleeve
Let me know the truth
Let me know the truth

Let me know the truth
Let me know the truth
RUN AWAY
I thought you would always be my friend
Now everything must end
And so the world moves on
And everything must change

When I'm looking at the night sky, I can see my soul
I see the little lights flashing at each other up above
Is it us making love in the Milky Way
Long before we threw it all away?

Hey you, we're running out of time
And you know it's true
I just want to run away from here with you
Tonight, tonight

Sometimes I wish I was a house at the end of the block
You could smash all my windows with the throw of a rock
And make the hurt go away, come again some other day
There's so much I want to say about

You, we're running out of time
And you know it's true
I just want to run away from here with you


And now you're all alone
You're sitting by the telephone
You wonder why
Everyone will cry
Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight
L.A. GIRLZ
L.A. girls, please act your age
You treat me like I have the plague
As I gyre and gimble in the wabe
L.A. girls, please act your age
Sweeten up your lemonade
And meet me down at Tower 28

I think I'm in Whiplash
I'm losing it mixing ammonia and bleach
I get off at Pico and sell my possessions
So you will know just how I feel
I love your long hair
But you just don't care
So please help me fathom
This world without music
And by the way, when can we talk?

L.A. girls, please act your age
You treat me like I have the plague
As I gyre and gimble in the wabe
L.A. girls, please act your age
Sweeten up your lemonade
And meet me down at Tower 28

So would you mind if I was pregnant?
I'll sleep on the edge of your bed
Like Dante and Beatrice
We'll light up our candles
But how is this going to end?
The kids are asleep
We're haunting their dreams
And some women swear it's more painful than labor
To die with your sins on your head

Does anybody love anybody as much as I love you, baby?
Does anybody love anybody as much as I love you, baby?
Does anybody love anybody as much as I love you, baby?
Does anybody love anybody as much as I love you, baby?

L.A. girls, please act your age
You treat me like I have the plague
It's the gyre and gimble in the wabe
L.A. girls, please act your age
Sweeten up your lemonade
And meet me down at tower twenty-eight
MISSTEP
Never before have I fallen for someone who'd go on and do me like this
You were the one who would always follow through with the ease of building care
For a kiss

Say you love me
Say you love me

Get out the house cause as long as you're cheating your concience will sit up
And say
Betting on losers is always a good way to lose what you wanted to prove

Say you love me
Say you love me

You should be talking better
But still you tried to better me
And now you'll be making the truth


You should be talking better
But still you tried to better me
And now you'll be making the truth

Get out the house cause as long as you're cheating your concience will sit up
And say
Betting on losers is always a good way to lose what you wanted to prove
DON'T LET GO
Ooh oh oh
Ooh oh oh

Any time that you want
I'll be here in your arms
Silently holding on
To the girl with the charms

But if there comes a day
You should turn your heart away
I'll be down on my knees
Begging for that girl to stay

Don't let go
Ooh oh oh
Don't let go
Ooh oh oh

Anything you desire
I will set at your feet
With a kiss in the air
For the gods to receive

But if there comes a day
You should turn your heart away
I'll be down on my knees
Begging for that girl to stay

Confrontations in my mind
Got me running out of time

Don't let go
Ooh oh oh
Don't let go
Ooh oh oh

But if there comes a day
You should turn your heart away
I'll be down on my knees
Begging for that girl to stay

Confrontations in my mind
Got me running out of time

Don't let go
Ooh oh oh
Don't let go
Ooh oh oh
Don't let go
Ooh oh oh
Don't let go
THE SPIDER
There's a spider in the drain and he's feeling pain
And he doesn't want to die any more than you or I
He's struggling to live but he doesn't have much time
Any more than you or I, you or I
We've got to die, we've got to live
We got to take what we can get
We sell ourselves for petty change
And when we die we rearrange
It's time to take it back again
It's time to take it back again
I want you to love me like I love you
There's nothing more for me to say
I spoke my piece I'll go on my way
And fare thee well where'er you go
You might need help but I won't know
Cause I'm up in here in my own cell
It could be heaven it could be hell
We'll never know just who we are
Cause when we die we become a star
And stars can't talk because they have
No mouth to speak about their past
They simply shine up in the sky
And give their light to you and I
And where would we be without their light
We'd call out names and then start a fight
But then again that's what we do
I hate me and I hate you too
Cause I'm in pain just like the spider
In the drain, I am a fighter
But I can't win I've got to lose
Give me strength to see me through
And ease the pain that I must feel
As my bones break and I taste the steel
As I go down... The drain...
I'm insane
BACK TO THE SHACK
Sorry guys, I didn't realize that I needed you so much
I thought I'd get a new audience, I forgot that disco sucks
I ended up with nobody and I started feelin' dumb
Maybe I should play the lead guitar and Pat should play the drums

Take me back, back to the shack
Back to the strat with the lightning strap
Kick in the door, more hardcore
Rockin' out like it's '94
Let's turn up the radio
Turn off those stupid singing shows
I know where we need to go:
Back to the shack

I finally settled down with my girl and I made up with my dad
Had to go and make a few mistakes so I could find out who I am
I'm lettin' all of these feelings out even if it means I fail
'Cause this is what I was meant to do and you can't put that on sale

Take me back, back to the shack
Back to the strat with the lightning strap
Kick in the door, more hardcore
Rockin' out like it's '94
Let's turn up the radio
Turn off those stupid singing shows
I know where we need to go:
Back to the shack

We belong in the rock world
There is so much left to do
If we die in obscurity, oh well
At least we raised some hell

Take me back, back to the shack
Back to the strat with the lightning strap
Kick in the door, more hardcore
Rockin' out like it's '94
Let's turn up the radio
Turn off those stupid singing shows
I know where we need to go:
Back to the shack
I'M A ROBOT
I ride the train to work every day
I reach my cubicle about 9 AM
I have to earn money to pay my bills
But I don't know how my life turned out this way

I'm a robot
I'm a robot
I don't have any feeling in my heart

I have a wife and a child waiting at home
Occasionally, I give my dog a bone (WOOF!)
If I am feeling wacky, then I might
Drink a quart of vodka, spend the night down in the gutter


Don't you worry...
Don't you worry about me
Don't you worry...
Don't you worry about me
This is how my father was
How his father was
Don't you worry...
Don't you worry about me

Don't have a can of beer
Stay with me for a while
Your mama don't expect you for awhile

Your mama never kissed you like this
Baby baby...
Haven't you seen the day?
Let your flowers out there in the sun
Baby baby...
You don't have to be afraid
Ain't nobody gonna hurt you anymore
Baby baby...
Haven't you seen the day?
Let your flowers out there in the sun
Baby baby...
You don't have to be afraid

Ain't nobody's gonna hurt you anymore
Ain't nobody's gonna hurt you anymore
Ain't nobody's gonna hurt you anymore

HEY DOMINGO!
One million people congregating
Fillin' up the Daegu streets
They join in the celebration
Hey, Domingo can't be beat
Each body look just like the last one
Twenty-one through twenty-five
Before you, if you dont belong here
Solidarity is nice
One voice united for a purpose
One voice to rise above the others
Is it the rage?
Where is rage, ooh?
Is it the same?
Where is the rage?
Is it the same?
Where is the rage?

JAMIE
Jamie, what you doin' now?
What you doin' now girl?
Please, please tell me
'Cuz I need to know, I need to know now
When I was down, you came to me
And promised you'd always be
By my side, now you're gone
And I'm waiting patiently

Jamie, Jamie
I'm so glad you're mine
We'll be together a long time
Jamie, what you doin' now?
Who's dialin' your car phone?

And promised you'd always be
By my side, now you're gone
And I'm waiting patiently
Jamie, I want you to know
Jamie, Jamie, I'm so glad you're mine
We'll be together a long time
You've got the Beach Boys, your firm's got the Stones
But I know you won't leave me alone
Sometimes it seems youre not with me
It hurts me so much, it hurts me so much
Sometimes it seems youre not with me
It hurts me so much, it hurts me so much
You are the most, you're so rad, you're so fresh
And I'm so glad
I am yours, you are mine
Show me where and I will sign

PARDON ME
I tried my best, I gave my all
Sometimes my best wasn't
Good enough for you
Sometimes I let you go
Sometimes I hurt you so
I know that I can be
The meanest person in the world

So I apologize to you
And to anyone else that I hurt too
I may not be a perfect soul
But I can learn self-control
So pardon me, pardon me
Pardon me my friend
I never thought that anyone
Was more important than
The plans I made
But now I feel the shame
There's no one else to blame
For all the broken hearts
Are scattered on the field of war

Sometimes I let you go
Sometimes I hurt you so
I know that I can be
The meanest person in the world
So I apologize to you
And to anyone else that I hurt too
I may not be a perfect soul
But I can learn self-control
And in my heart I feel it's true
So I will be there with you
So pardon me, pardon me
Pardon me my friend
(I really want a friend)
YELLOW CAMARO
When the wheels are in motion for good times
God bless the U.S. assembly line
It’s a game when you play with high octane
That’s the pace of the race we’re following
Ride on
Yellow
Camaro
With freedom of eagles you soar high
God bless, what a mess, yet still we fly
It’s a shame that we’ve done such a dumb thing
That’s the pace of the race we’re following
I WOKE UP IN LOVE THIS MORNING
Last night, I turned out the light, lay down and thought about you
I thought about the way that it could be
Two o'clock, wonderin' what I'm doin' here alone without you
So I close my eyes and dream you here to me and...
I woke up in love this morning
I woke up in love this morning
Went to sleep with you on my mind
I woke up in love this morning
I woke up in love this morning
Went to sleep with you on my mind
Hello, girl, yes it's five o'clock I know but you just listen
There's something that I've got to let you know
This is you, this pillow that I'm huggin' and I'm kissin'
And one more thing before I let you go...
I woke up in love this morning
I woke up in love this morning
Went to sleep with you on my mind
I woke up in love this morning
I woke up in love this morning
Went to sleep with you on my mind
Do dreams come true, well if they do, I'll have you
Not just for a night, but for my whole life through
I woke up in love this morning
I woke up in love this morning
Went to sleep with you on my mind
I woke up in love this morning
I woke up in love this morning
Went to sleep with you on my mind
I woke up in love
I woke up in love
I woke up in love on my mind
MY EVALINE
My Evaline
Say you'll be mine
Won't you come and let me whisper in your ear
Way down yonder in the old corn field
For you
I've pined
Sweeter than the honey
To the honey bee
I love you
Say you love me
Meet me in the shade
Of the old apple tree
Eva-Iva-Ova-Evaline
ANY FRIEND OF DIANE'S
Any friend of Diane's is a friend of mine
Any friend of Diane's is a friend of mine
Home is where the heart is (Ooh)
Any friend of Diane's is a friend of mine

Working at Papa John's I was making good bread
Got a $20 tip on New Years'
And I moved out to LA
She drew me up a map with a fountain pen
She took me to Hermosa
With the boys from down the way

Any friend of Diane's is a friend of mine
Any friend of Diane's is a friend of mine
Home is where the heart is (Ooh)
Any friend of Diane's is a friend of mine

Head bang from the crowd; dive on the stage
With black hair and a Smiths shirt
Meat Is Murder
I asked her if she had a boyfriend, she said no
I asked her if she had a girlfriend
She said "Hell, I wouldn't know"

Any friend of Diane's is a friend of mine
Any friend of Diane's is a friend of mine
Home is where the heart is (Ooh)
Any friend of Diane's is a friend of mine

Went down to the bank of the river
And she washed my dirty hands
I've been hanging around in a cloud of shame
Till she let me taste the cold water


Diane would help me pass out all the fliers
I became a big shot
And she got sick one day
I still have the map she drew for me
I'd be lost without it
There's so much I wanna say

Any friend of Diane's is a friend of mine
Any friend of Diane's is a friend of mine
Home is where the heart is (Ooh)
Any friend of Diane's is a friend of mine
THE BRITISH ARE COMING
"Welcome to the first level literati
Our mission is to keep the tradition alive
It's up to us
It's our responsibility
Who else is going to do it?"
This is the night
Light up the fire in the forge
We're not the coins in the coffer of old King George
One if by land
Two if they come by sea
We'll show 'em we are the true sons of liberty
Punk ass redcoats tryin' to run the show
Telling me what to do and where to go
Mount your horse 'cause it's time to tell the world
The British are coming
The British are coming
The British are coming
Smear on the soot
Tear up an old deer skin shirt
We know the shot will be heard all around the world
Punk ass redcoats tryin' to run the show
Telling me what to do and where to go
Mount your horse 'cause it's time to tell the world
The British are coming
The British are coming
The British are coming
This is the destiny of all mankind
We will shake off these chains and shackles that bind
Come on let's give them everything we have
The British are coming
The British are coming
The British are coming
POLYNESIA

PRODIGY LOVER
Something is different
Something has changed
You write me your letters
They're not the same
Prodigy lover
Playing the keyboards
Drowning that music from me
Uncomprehending
I'm stupified
'Cause I wrote the rulebook
You can't abide
Over and over
Checking the airwaves
Drowning that music from me
You say ok
We'll both become
The kings of money
Over and over
Checking the airwaves
Drowning that music from me
You say ok
We'll both become
The kings of money
Uncomprehending
I'm stupified
Cause I wrote the rulebook
You can't abide
I wrote the rulebook
You can't abide
I wrote the rulebook
You can't abide
Oh no
I'm stupified
Oh no
I'm stupified
Oh no

Alright
HOLIDAY
Let's go away for a while
You and I
To a strange and distant land
Where they speak no word of truth
But we don't understand anyway

Holiday
Far away, to stay
On a holiday, far away
Let's go today
In a heartbeat!

Heartbeat, heartbeat

Don't bother to pack your bags or your map
We won't need them where we're going
We're going where the wind is blowing
Not knowing where we're gonna stay

Holiday
Far away, to stay
On a holiday, far away, to stay
On a holiday, far away
Let's go today
In a heartbeat!

Heartbeat, heartbeat
Heartbeat, heartbeat

We'll write a postcard
To our friends and family
In free verse
We will write a postcard
To our friends and family
(On the road with Kerouac)
In free verse
(Sheltered in his bivouac)
We will write a postcard
To our friends and family
(On this road, we'll never die)
In free verse

Heartbeat, heartbeat

Let's go away for a while
You and I
To a strange and distant land
Where they speak no word of truth
But we don't understand anyway

Holiday
Far away, to stay
On a holiday
Far away, to stay
On a holi-

Let's go away
Let's go away
Let's go away
Let's go away
In a heartbeat!
TAKE ON ME
Talking away
Though I don't know what I'm to say
I'll say it anyway
Today's another day to find you
Shying away
I'll be coming for your love, okay?

Take on me (Take on me)
Take me on (Take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two

So needless to say
I'm odds and ends
But I'll be stumbling away
Slowly learning that life is okay
Say after me
It's no better to be safe than sorry

Take on me (Take on me)
Take me on (Take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two

Oh, things that you say
Is it life or just to play my worries away?
You're all the things I've got to remember
You're shying away
Oh, I'll be coming for you anyway

Take on me (Take on me)
Take me on (Take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day
Take on me (Take on me)
Take me on (Take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day
KEEP FISHIN'
You'll never be a better kind
If you don't leave the world behind

Waste my days (waste my days)
You're drowned aways (drowned aways)

It's just the thought of you
In love with someone else
It breaks my heart to see you
Hangin' from your shelf

You'll never do the things you want
If you don't move and get a job

Waste my days (waste my days)
You're drowned aways (drowned aways)

It's just the thought of you
In love with someone else
It breaks my heart to see you
Hangin' from your shelf

Oh girl, when I'm in love with you
Keep fishin' if you feel it's true
There's nothin' much that we can do
To save you from yourself

Waste my days (waste my days)
You're drowned aways (drowned aways)

It's just the thought of you
In love with someone else
It breaks my heart to see you
Hangin' from your shelf

Oh girl, when I'm in love with you
Keep fishin' if you feel it's true
There's nothin' much that we can do
To save you from yourself

You'll never be a better kind
You'll never be a better kind
Waste my days
Waste my days
Waste my days
Waste my days
Waste my days
Waste my days (Whoa-oh)
Waste my days (Whoa-oh, whoa-oh)
Waste my days (Oh, oh)
Waste my days (Oh, oh)
Waste my days
ON THE EDGE
Things are so complicated now, I think I'm gonna throw up my neck
I don't know what tomorrow brings, and either way I can't check
I go out to the movies I tell my girl she's groovy But no one ever seems to get satisfied
Things are so complicated now, I think I'm gonna curl up and die
One minute things are in my head, and not matter how I try
Can't seem to get sorted
My plans end up boarded
The days sink through my crotchet hands like rain
There ain't no better way to ride
I've punched the devil in the eye
There ain't no better way to live, on the edge!
Things are odd doubled in knots, and I'm caught in the spite of shred
Only just a matter of time before he comes to eat up my head
So I better do now
Fun time is all through now
Give my blessings to those who came on
There ain't no better way to ride
I've punched the devil in the eye
There ain't no better way to live, on the edge!
There ain't no better way to ride
I've punched the devil in the eye
There ain't no better way to live, on the edge!
There ain't no better ways to fly
I've punched the devil in the eye
There ain't no better way to live, on the edge
On high...
On high...
GETTING UP AND LEAVING
My life is changing
And I'm feeling blue
The things I wished for
Have come true

Stop!
I really really wanna go back
Back to where I belong

Now I'm getting up and leaving
I'm leaving home
Now I'm getting up and leaving
I wanna go home

Don't write no music
Don't read no books
Don't call my baby
On the phone

Stop!
I really really wanna go back
Back to where I came from
Stop!
I really really wanna go back
Back to where I belong

Now I'm getting up and leaving
I'm leaving home
Now I'm getting up and leaving
I wanna go home

Now I'm getting up
Now I'm getting up
Now I'm getting up and leaving
(Now I'm getting up)
(Now I'm getting up)
Now I'm leaving
FEELS LIKE SUMMER
Climbing up the tower
Just a boy and his computer
I'm still in my bathrobe
Hiding in the shadows
I'm not used to losing
Bye, bye, sugar blue eyes
You're home with the angels
Thank you for being so kind

I'm holding on and I don't want to let you go
Yeah it feels like summer
Yeah it feels like summer to me
Yeah it feels like summer
Yeah it feels like summer to me
And she was a lover to me, to me, to me, to me

Which way is the graveyard?
I'm an iceberg with a warm heart
I'm spiritual, not religious
I'm a Libra, if it matters
Shattered by an email
Your words will fade away
Castle built in the sand
Will only last one day

I'm holding on and I don't want to let you go
Yeah it feels like summer
Yeah it feels like summer to me
Yeah it feels like summer
Yeah it feels like summer to me
When she was a lover to me

June bride, shine so bright
Flowers in her hair, but it just ain't right
June bride, shine so bright
Flowers in her hair, we look good together
We look good together

Yeah it feels like summer
Yeah it feels like summer to me
When she was a lover to me

Let me see the smile, stay with me awhile
I cried for you, you were the song in my life
Let me see the smile, stay with me awhile
I cry for you, you were the song in my life
SERENDIPITY
Gimme some lovin'
Gimme some lovin'
Gimme some o' that lovin'

You better do that
Told you that I want to
Told you that I want to
Told you that I have to

You better do that
If it's only rock and roll
How come music's in my soul?
Turn it on
Come on let's go
Yeah, right now, yeah...
If it's only rock and roll
How come music's in my soul?
Turn it on
Come on let's go
Yeah, right now
Right now
I DON'T WANT YOUR LOVING
You are cool and you're hot
And you know what you've got
You can have anyone
You just call and they come
But I won't be a number on your list
I have way too much pride to go for this

'Cuz I don't want your loving
I don't want your love
You came back this morning
But I don't want your love

When I turn you away
You don't know what to say
Every word that you know
Gets caught up in your throat
Because nobody ever turned you down
Well I guess you had better learn to frown

'Cuz I don't want your loving
I don't want your love
You came back this morning
But I don't want your love

Ooh, why don't you tell me goodbye
Ooh, why don't you tell me
Why don't you tell me goodbye
So I won't be a number on your list
I have too much pride to go for this
No, I don't want your lovin'
I don't want your love
You came back this mornin'
But, I don't want your love
I don't want your lovin'
I don't want your love
I don't want your lovin'
You can pack it up
TIRED OF SEX
I'm tired
So tired
I'm tired of having sex

I'm spread
So thin
I don't know who I am
(Who I am) Oh

Tuesday night, I'm making Lyn
Wednesday night, I'm making Catherine
Oh, why can't I be making love come true?

Tonight, tonight, please
Oh, why can't I be making love come true?

COLD DARK WORLD
I've been watching you, girl, from the back of my car
I see you're unsure of the place that you are
Groceries spilling up out of your bag
Thinking you'll end up a penniless hag
But I see the girl that you are deep inside
Won't you allow me to give you a ride
I can console you and give you a kiss
Show you that you can do better than this

Angel girl in a cold dark world
I'm going to be your man
Angel girl in a cold dark world
I'll make you understand

I know that you're thinking I'm trying to score
But deep in your heart you know that I'm more
Than a cad or a scoundrel, now that I've found you
I don't want to lose you, how can I prove to you
That I am sincere, you don't need to fear
I'm not like the others, I'll be like a brother
I will protect you, never disrespect you
But if you need love then I'll be here to sex you

Angel girl in a cold dark world
I'm going to be your man, I'm gonna be there
Angel girl in a cold dark world
I'll make you understand

It might take a while to get with the style
Of life at the end of the miracle mile
But you're going to love the rising above
All the trash that is sweeping you under the rug
I'm going to be there

Angel girl in a cold dark world
I'm going to be your man
Angel girl in a cold dark world
I'll make you understand
SEAFARING JAMB
Everybody don't make me laugh
'Cause it's not so insane
In the morning it comes to pass
And there's no one to blame
I'll tell you my weakness
And if you knew the things I've seen
Then you'd have to believe
In the spirits above the sand
In the man in the tree
I'll tell you my weakness
And if you like it there
I'll be most everywhere
Tell me to stay
Need me to stay
I'll tell you my weakness
And if you like it there
I'll be most everywhere
Tell me to stay
Need me to stay
And if you knew the things I've seen
Then you'd have to believe
Then you'd have to believe
Then you'd have to believe
Believe
MANSION OF CARDBOARD
Overcoat
Old wool cap
Leather gloves
Hide the fat
In a world made of tears
He is safe from his fears
On his own
He's on his own (on his own)
He likes it that way
Thoughts arise
Fear is doubt
Bearing through
Giving smell
It's the happiest day
When he moves far away
From the crowd
The curious crowd
He wants them to
Stand back the old man's snoring heavy
Down underneath the bridge he's got his
Mansion of cardboard slats
And it's enough
Oohhhh

It's the happiest day
When he moves far away
From the crowd
The curious crowd
He wants them to
Stand back the old man's snoring heavy
Down underneath the bridge he's got his
Mansion of cardboard slats
And it's enough (x2)
Oooh
SMILE
Open the door and let your love come down
Over the wall, you're spinning 'round and 'round
Because you wanted some love
I'll make it happen

'Cause I don't want to break
Your fine face, I can't take
The way you want to wrap me up
Inside your smile

Open your heart and let the good stuff out
Water me girl and let me ease the drought
Because you wanted some love
I'll make it happen

'Cause I don't want to break
Your fine face, I can't take
The way you want to wrap me up
Inside your smile

I can't be gone, darling
For very long, no
Never know what you're going to do
Standing there deep in front of you
Take a look in between my eyes
Because I'm back, yeah

'Cause I don't want to break
Your fine face, I can't take
The way you want to wrap me up
Inside your smile

I can't be gone, darling
For very long, no
Never know what you're going to do
Standing there deep in front of you
Take a look in between my eyes
Because I'm back, yeah

Give me a chance if you can force yourself
Look at me girl and get up off your shelf
Because you wanted some love
I'll make it happen
DUKES OF HAZARD
Just two good old boys
(Everyone now, come on)
Never meaning no harm
Beats all you never saw
Been in trouble with the law
Since the day they was born
(What were they doing man?)
Straightening the curves
Flattening the hills
Well, someday the mountain might get 'em
But the law never will
Making their way
The only way they know how
That's just a little bit more
Than the law will allow
Just two good ol' boys
Wouldn't change if they could
They're fighting the system
Like two modern-day Robin Hoods
LET'S SEW OUR PANTS TOGETHER
Raise the window
Its getting hot in here
All these breathers
And all of these suckers
Shake my hand now
Pleased to meet you but
Skin is pretty
But underneath you're a monster
Are we friends now?
Am I your brother?
Can we bleed together
Are we lovers?
Let's sew our pants together
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Let's climb right in forever
6, 7, 8, 9, 10
Then won't we all be so clever?
If we sew our pants together
Wake the next morning
One below the waist
But you want poached eggs
And I want to go to the bathroom
What do we do now?
What do we make of this?
Can my blood flow
Apart from your stitch?
Let's sew our pants together
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Let's climb right in forever
6, 7, 8, 9, 10
Then won't we all be so clever?
If we sew our pants together
Lets set our hair on fire
Lets throw our hearts in the mire
Lets sell our eggs to any buyer
We've made a liar of desire
Lets sew our pants together
Lets sew our pants together
We've made a liar of desire
We've made a liar of desire
We've made a liar of desire
We've made a liar of desire
PIECE OF CAKE
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do

Let's do hard drugs
Fix our problems
Let me swing by
Tears in my eyes

She cut me like a piece of cake
She cut me like a piece of cake
Hope can drive a man insane
She ate me up

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do

Weep for Betty

She cut me like a piece of cake

Hope can drive a man insane
She ate me up

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do

She was into me
And then she changed the dial like I'm grunge or gangsta rap
Now I'm hanging out
With a kitty cat named Baudelaire on my lap
I never stopped her planets turning, no

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do

Hey man, cheer up
Make your own luck

She cut me like a piece of cake

Hope can drive a man insane
She ate me up (Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
She cut me like a piece of cake (Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
She cut me like a piece of cake (Do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
Hope can drive a man insane (Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
She ate me up
LIVING IN L.A.
I'm back in black, no one to hold my hand
It seems that we're together, but alone
And now I hear the ticking of a clock
I know we're going down a slippery slope

I wonder what it's like out there
And my eyes are like far away spaceships (Uh)
You are a sealed up door
There's gotta be more to our lives than this

This girl I like
I'm talking 'bout this girl I like
But I feel so lonely, feel so lonely
Uh, uh, yeah, I'm living in L.A
This girl I like
I'm talking 'bout this girl I like
But I feel so lonely, feel so lonely
Uh, uh, yeah, I'm living in L.A

We're fortune's fools when we took the bait
We sacrifice our lives for rock and roll
Je ne sais pas, burning at the stake
We never really had a choice at all

I wonder what it's like out there
And my eyes are two far away spaceships
You are a sealed up door
And there's gotta be more to our lives than this

This girl I like
I'm talking 'bout this girl I like
But I feel so lonely, feel so lonely
Uh, uh, yeah, I'm living in L.A
This girl I like
I'm talking 'bout this girl I like
But I feel so lonely, feel so lonely
Uh, uh, yeah, I'm living in L.A

Looking for a fight, looking for a fight
And I'm still trying to figure out my life
Pretending we don't want each other
Alright, now
Looking for a fight, looking for a fight
And the spider is sucking out my life
And I'm reaching out to touch her (Oh)

This girl I like
I'm talking 'bout this girl I like
But I feel so lonely, feel so lonely
Uh, uh, yeah, I'm living in L.A
This girl I like
I'm talking 'bout this girl I like
But I feel so lonely, feel so lonely
Uh, uh, yeah, I'm living in L.A
This girl I like
I'm talking 'bout this girl I like
But I feel so lonely, feel so lonely
Uh, uh, yeah, I'm living in L.A
KNOCK-DOWN DRAG-OUT
Any day now, you'll call me up on the phone
Say you love me more than you ever did before

It's all that I can do right now
I'll make it up to you somehow
And meet you on the other side of hope

Take no prisoners here in this knock-down drag-out war
That we're waging on each other forever more

It's all that I can do right now
I'll make it up to you somehow
And meet you on the other side of hope

Say you love me now

It's all that I can do right now
I'll make it up to you somehow
And meet you on the other side of hope

Take no prisoners here in this knock-down drag-out war
That we're waging on each other forever more
That we're waging on each other forever more
CHRISTMAS CELEBRATION
Christmas celebration
All around the nation
Won't you stay with me tonight
Cuz i'm running out of fight
And the pagentry is such a bore
Carollers are singing
Registers ka-chinging
And the presents are in place
But i'd rather eat some mace
'cause that egg nog always make me sick
You know how the story goes
You've seen it all before
That man is so obese that
Can't get out the door
Christmas to perfection
I'm begging for some action
And the ringing in my ears
Is the sound of christmas cheer
'cause they've knocked me screaming overboard
You know how the story goes
You've seen it all before
That man is so obese that
Can't get out the door
You know how the story goes
You've seen it all before
That man is so obese that
Can't get out the door
Christmas celebration
All around the nation
Won't you stay with me tonight
Cuz i'm running out of fight
And the pagentry is such a bore
The pagentry is such a bore
The pagentry is such a bore
The pagentry is such a bore
The pagentry is such a bore
III. RETURN TO ITHAKA
(Instrumental)
WIND IN OUR SAIL
A boy and a girl
Albatross around their necks
Hands burning from the rope
Ship stranded in the tropics
Acidification wiped out the tiger shark
Let's try to save their souls
And trust the man with the Torah

We got the wind in our sail
Like Darwin on the Beagle
Or Mendel experimenting with a pea
We got the wind in our sail
And we can do so many great things together, together

Breathe in the salt
Slicing waves at 40 knots
Cumulonimbus in the sky
This is what we've waited for
And now there's no more hyperventilating in wheelchairs
We're gonna save the last auk on Funk Island
We had to do it wrong before we could do it right

We got the wind in our sail
Like Darwin on the Beagle
Or Mendel experimenting with a pea
We got the wind in our sail
And we can do so many great things together, together

Pushing the stone up the hill and if it rolls back down
Whoa, Sisyphus it rolls back down
Pushing the stone up the hill and if it rolls back down
Whoa, Sisyphus it rolls back down

We got the wind in our sail
Like Darwin on the Beagle
Or Mendel experimenting with a pea
We got the wind in our sail
And we can do so many great things together, together
SATURDAY NIGHT (MALADROIT DEMO)
Saturday Night
Oh how I love that song
Proves to me that I'm wrong
The night away (Now that you loved it, wrong)
Give to me, girl
All of the love that I need
Ooh when I'm hungry I feed
The night away (Now that you loved it, wrong)
Dreams will never happen to you (They'll never happen to you)
Once you feel the freedom is true
I'll be with you
Plantin' your seed (Now that you loved it)
Deep in the heart of the Earth
Tryin' to kneel and give birth/Fall to my knees and give birth
The night away (Now that you loved it, wrong)
Watchin' it grow
Never again will I weep (Now that you loved it)
Now that I see that you keep
The night away (Now that you loved it, wrong)
Dreams will never happen to you (They'll never happen to you)
Once you feel the freedom is true
I'll be
Holdin' on
Holdin' on
So in love with yourself (So in love)
With you
With you
Dreams will never happen to you (They'll never happen to you)
Once you feel the freedom is true
I'll be
Holdin' on
Holdin' on
So in love with yourself (So in love)
With you
With you
With you (ah)
Oh with you
With you

ARE 'FRIENDS' ELECTRIC
It's cold outside
And the paint's peeling off of my walls
There's a man outside
In a long coat, grey hat
Smoking a cigarette

Now the light fades out
And I'm wondering what I'm doing in a room like this
There's a knock on the door
And just for a second I thought I remembered you
 (Spoken)
So now I'm alone
Now I can think for myself
About little deals
And issues
And things I just don't understand
Like a white lie at night
Or a slight touch at times
I don't think it meant anything to you

So I open the door
Its the friend that I'd left in the hallway
Please sit down
A candle lit shadow on a wall near the bed

You know I hate to ask
But, are friends electric?
Only, mines broke down
And now I've no one to love
 (Spoken)
So I find out your reason
For the phone calls and smiles
And it hurts
And I'm lonely
And I should never have tried
And I missed you tonight
So it's time to leave
You see this means everything to me
CLEOPATRA
We grow old, our hearts are dim
But our minds are free, to fly where they will
Your beauty is faded, you're a broken shell
It's only the weak that fall for your spell
You can't control me no more Cleopatra, -patra, -patra
You can't control me no more Cleopatra, -patra, -patra
It's time to move to the next life
You'll be reborn as a beautiful child
You'll turn the heads of a million men
Lady Pharaoh, the Jewel of the Nile
You can't control me no more Cleopatra, -patra, -patra
You can't control me no more Cleopatra, -patra, -patra
All the wine we tasted, all the love we made
All the strumming lyres will decorate your grave
All the ecstasy is gone, gone, gone away
Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five, thirty, thirty-five, forty
You're older, you're colder
Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five, thirty, thirty-five, forty
You're older, you're colder
You can't control me no more Cleopatra, -patra, -patra
You can't control me no more Cleopatra, -patra, -patra
You can't control me no more Cleopatra, -patra, -patra
You can't control me no more Cleopatra, -patra, -patra
Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five, thirty, thirty-five, forty
You're older, you're colder
Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five, thirty, thirty-five, forty
You're older, you're colder
SUSANNE
Susanne, you're all that I wanted of a girl
You're all that I need in the world
I'm your child
Make me blush, drive me wild
Susanne, you're all that I wanted
When I met you I was all alone
Cold and hungry cryin' on the phone
You baked me brownies and said "don't you cry"
And gave me the coat off your back
Susanne, you're all that I wanted of a girl
You're all that I need in the world
I'm your child
Make me blush, drive me wild
Susanne, you're all that I wanted
Even Izzy, Slash and Axl Rose
When I call you put them all on hold
And say to me that you'd do anything
And all I can do is say that
I haven't much I can give you in return
Only my heart and a promise not to turn
But I'll sing to you every day and every night
Susanne, I'm your man
Susanne, you're all that I wanted of a girl
You're all that I need in the world
I'm your child
Make me blush, drive me wild
Susanne, you're all that I wanted
Of a girl
YEAH!
KING OF THE WORLD
You walk by the magazines
Sitting on the rack at the CVS
One more sad movie star divorce
Three hundred died in an airplane wreck
And you think of all the people suffering
And you bury that pain
But you can tell me everything
And we’ll ride on that wave

If I was king of the world
You’d be my girl
You wouldn’t have to shed one single tear
Unless you wanted to
‘Cause yeah I know what it’s like
If I was king of the world
Yeah, girl
We could ride a Greyhound all the way to the Galapagos
And stay for the rest of our lives(ooohh ohhhh ohhhh ohhh)

Dad hit you on the hand
Just for holding your chopsticks wrong
Then your Mom locked you in a shed
And Uncle Sam dropped an atom bomb
But you’re not alone
You can let it go
And just weep on my breast
And cover me with your tenderness
And that pain will pass

If I was king of the world
You’d be my girl
You wouldn’t have to shed one single tear
Unless you wanted to
‘Cause yeah I know what it’s like
If I was king of the world
Yeah, girl
We could ride a Greyhound all the way to the Galapagos
And stay for the rest of our lives(ooohh ohhhh ohhhh ohhh)

We are the small fish
We swim together(ohh)
No Prozac or Valium
We’ll face tsunamis together

If I was king of the world
You’d be my girl
You wouldn’t have to shed one single tear
Unless you wanted to
‘Cause yeah I know what it’s like
If I was king of the world
Yeah, girl
We could ride a greyhound all the way to the Galapagos
And stay for the rest of our lives(ooohh ohhhh ohhhh ohhh)
PEACE
More and more
I can't say no
So afraid of letting go
If there's something
I can grab
You can bet
I'll pay the tab
Counting all the flowers
Waste the precious hours
I need to find some peace
All these problems on my mind
Make it hard for me to think
There is no way I can stop
My poor brain is gonna' pop
And I don't have a purpose
Scattered on the surface
I need to find some peace
And all the broken tethers
We can bring together
I need to find some peace
I need to find some peace
I need to find some peace
THE ORGAN PLAYER
The people come and lay down on the ground
They want to hear all the beautiful sounds
Of the organ player
But in the crowd is a bitter young man
He can't accept what the other ones can
That the song is greater than him

Spreading venom in the crowd
Laughing high horses are loud
The player plays ever furiously
He won't be swayed from the right melody
Because he knows its beauty
The bitter man shoots his arrows of flame
He's got to take out the source of his pain
At the cost of righteous thinking

Casting necromancer spells
Summoning demons from hell

The tones rise up
And spill his cup
He can't defeat this tune

Casting necromancer spells
Summoning demons from hell
Another verse and the melodies rise
A perfect tune doesn't need a disguise
Cause there is no fighting
And nature says what is high and is low
Father Time will reveal what is show
And the bitter man is falling

The tones rise up
And spill his cup
He can't defeat this tune
Another verse and the melodies rise
A perfect tune doesn't need a disguise
Cause there is no fighting
And nature says what is high and is low
Father Time will reveal what is show
And the bitter man is falling
On his knees
SAY IT AIN'T SO
Oh yeah
Alright

Somebody's Heine'
Is crowding my icebox
Somebody's cold one
Is giving me chills
Guess I'll just close my eyes

Oh yeah, alright
Feels good, inside

Flip on the telly
Wrestle with Jimmy
Something is bubbling
Behind my back
The bottle is ready to blow

Say it ain't so
Your drug is a heartbreaker
Say it ain't so
My love is a life taker

I can't confront you
I never could do that which might hurt you
So try and be cool
When I say
"This way is a water slide away from me
That takes you further every day"
So be cool

Say it ain't so
Your drug is a heartbreaker
Say it ain't so
My love is a life taker

Dear Daddy, I write you
In spite of years of silence
You've cleaned up, found Jesus
Things are good, or so I hear
This bottle of Stephen's
Awakens ancient feelings
Like father, stepfather
The son is drowning in the flood
Yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah


Say it ain't so
Your drug is a heartbreaker
Say it ain't so
My love is a life taker
BLAST OFF!
T-minus 10
9, 8
7, 6
5, 4
3, 2
1, 0

Blast off! Up to the stars we go!
And leave behind everything I used to know
Somebody's giving me a whole lot of money
To do what I think I want to
So why am I still feeling blue? Oh Wuan and Dondo!

Goddamn! Get your head out of your hands!
Here's to all the times we're gonna have
Cooped up for a year with the two best looking
Babes I've seen all year

Get me another bottle of beer, cause I'm feelin' fine!

Go ahead, waste your head
We've got the time
I hope you don't object that I
Speak my mind

Don't forget the purpose of the mission
Or Nomis will get swallowed by its sun
Each one of you is a top graduate
Of the Star Corps Academy
It's up to you to reach for a dream! Oh Wuan and Dondo!

Go ahead, waste your life
On silly fears
I hope you don't object if I
Crack another beer, yeah!

Hold on, who is it here that I see?
Wasn't she your favorite bitch in the academy?

I don't know if I wanna lead on this woman
You know, I've done that before
She's actually a good girl

Or at least a cheap ho...
QB BLITZ
All of my conversations die a painful death you see
I can't get anyone to do algebra with me
It's hard to make real friends
My friends have lots of friends
I don't hang out enough
Take drugs and learn to love

This intercom is broken into pieces
I gotta call my QB Blitz, B Blitz
Out on the ice fields of Hoth
I'll be
I'll be missing you like oxygen (xygen)
Whoah whoah whoah
I'll be missing you like oxygen

I wanna have the feeling someone's in love with me
You gotta choose between the internet and me
People don't bring me joy
I think you get the point
I'm on an epic quest
Pursuit of happiness

This intercom is broken into pieces
I gotta call my QB Blitz, B Blitz
Out on the ice fields of Hoth
I'll be
I'll be missing you like oxygen (xygen)
Whoah whoah whoah
I'll be missing you like oxygen

Sing for the moment
Little place on the ocean
In the middle of a snowdrift
We're alone in the universe
Sing for the moment
With a paper lantern over the light
Sing for the moment

This intercom is broken into pieces
I gotta call my QB Blitz, B Blitz
Out on the ice fields of Hoth
I'll be
I'll be missing you like oxygen (xygen)
Whoah whoah whoah
I'll be missing you like oxygen
THE PRETTIEST GIRL IN THE WHOLE WORLD
Sunshine is falling
Over my head
Turtle doves are calling
Good morning, friends
And I've got the prettiest girl in the whole wide world
And nobody can take her from me
And in the evening when she goes out walking alone
I'll wait at home patiently
I've never been so happy
I've never been so sure
Ohh...
Red roses blooming
All unaware
Of seasons turning
Of coming care
I've got the prettiest girl in the whole wide world
And nobody can take her from me
And in the evening when she goes out walking alone
I'll wait at home patiently
I've never been so happy
I've never been so sure
I've got the prettiest girl in the world
And I'm in love with her
I've got the prettiest girl in the whole wide world
And nobody can take her from me
And in the evening when she goes out walking alone
I'll wait at home patiently
I've never been so happy
I've never been so sure
I've got the prettiest girl in the world
And I'm in love with her
WAITING ON YOU
Why haven't you called me?
Did you forget me?
I need to know
When were you intending to break the silence
And let me know?

Mine is the loneliest of numbers
Now is the loneliest of times
You're 19 days late
But still, I sit and wait, oh

Waiting and waiting
Waiting and waiting
Waiting and waiting
Waiting on you

Who have you been seeing that made you forget me?
I bet you call him
Where, oh where does he come from?
I bet he lives close by
I bet he's just a friend

Mine is the loneliest of numbers
Now is the loneliest of times
You're 19 days late
But still, I sit and wait, oh

Waiting and waiting
Waiting and waiting
Waiting and waiting
Waiting on you
Waiting and waiting
Waiting and waiting
You've got me waiting
Waiting on you

I asked you if you had a good heart
You answered, "Yes, I'll never do you harm."
I asked you if you had a good heart
You answered, "Yes, I'll never do you harm."
O LISA
Simple stages in my mind
Now i'm running out of time
I'm wanting to
I wanna do you
Taking stock of feelings stored
Running circles overboard
I'm wanting to i wanna do you
O lisa
Can you
Love me again?
I'll be holding on till then
Only old enough to tell
What is right and what is hell
I'm wanting to
I wanna do you
And if this is our last goodbye
I would love to see you cry
I'm wanting to
I wanna do you
O lisa
Can you
Love me again?
I'll be holding on till then
I'll be holding on till then
O lisa
Can you
Love me again?
I'll be holding on till then
And if this is our last goodbye
I would love to see you cry
I'm wanting to
I wanna do you
I wanna do you
I wanna do you
I wanna do you
SUPERSTAR (SS2K VERSION)
There used to be a better kind
Of rock and rollin' superstar
They'd strut around and do their thing
All I know how to do is sing
And I don't do that so well
I never summon things from hell
I'm just a regular white guy
Who's afraid to rock so hard
I'd break my guard
And give myself away
Away
There used to be a better brand
Of frontman personality
But I don't do that so well
I never summon things from hell
I'm just a regular white guy
Who's afraid to rock so hard
I'd break my guard
And give myself away
Away
But I don't do that so well
I never summon things from hell
I'm just a regular white guy
Who's afraid to rocket to the sky
Who's afraid to rocket to the sky
Who's afraid to rock so hard
I break my guard
And give myself away
Away
DEVOTION
Suddenly, our shortcomings don't seem to matter that much
Your IQ is twenty points low
And I'm no six foot, hot look, All-American man
Sad to say, I pushed you away
Waiting for "Mrs. Right"

You never gave up
Devotion, waiting for me
You'll always be my girlfriend
I, too, am waiting for you
I'll always be your friend

I commend your stubbornness
Without it, we'd have never got this far
I am done with perfection
Chasing her leaves me with nothing but pain
Unlike you, she isn't true
She's got her own concerns

You never gave up
Devotion, waiting for me
You'll always be my girlfriend
I, too, am waiting for you
I'll always be your friend


Devotion, waiting for me
You'll always be my girlfriend
I, too, am waiting for you
I'll always be your friend
DO YOU WANNA GET HIGH?
 (Spoken)
Cue the feedback

Crush up the blue
And inhale through your nose
Scrape every quark
From the wood in the floor

She said:
Do you wanna get high?
Don’t eat no dinner tonight
I took a road trip to Mexico
And scored a hundred count
Do you wanna get high?
It’s like we’re falling in love
We can listen to Bacharach
And stop at any point

Now our bones start to ache
As we cramp on the pot
And we fall to the floor
With our face in a knot

She said:
Do you wanna get high?
Don’t eat no dinner tonight
I took a road trip to Mexico
And scored a hundred count
Do you wanna get high?
It’s like we’re falling in love
We can listen to Bacharach
And stop at any point

Keep on doing what you do
‘Cuz I’ll never get tired of you
Don’t need booze
‘Cuz I’ll never get tired of you
Stop the tape, kill the lights, close the drapes
And keep doing what you do
‘Cuz I’ll never get tired of you


She said:
Do you wanna get high?
Don’t eat no dinner tonight
I took a road trip to Mexico
And scored a hundred count
Do you wanna get high?
It’s like we’re falling in love
We can listen to Bacharach
And stop at any point

Sleeping with Mother Theresa
Drifting in a lone fantasia
Brahmin you recite the veda
Beautiful as euthanasia
BRAVE NEW WORLD
I've been scared to make a move
So much left for me to prove
I guess it's time for me to show what I've got
Things will never be the same
I may snuff the burning flame
Or I may prove to be much more than I thought

This is the dawning of a brave new world
I don't know where I'm going, but I know I'll figure it out, yeah
This is the dawning of a brave new world
No more hesitating, it's too late to turn back now, yeah

You can come along with me
Or if that's not your destiny
You can choose to go your way if you want
I will send my best to you
There are things I have to do
I can't wait no more, I've got to move on


It does not take this action
To see a chain reaction
Everyone, blossoming in the sun
(Ooh) We'd hate to leave our shelter
But there's so much waiting out there
If only we'd open our eyes and see
Woah... woah... woah... woah...
THE LAST DAYS OF SUMMER
It's fun to go sans air conditioning
We feel the weather change
We spray each other's face
We chase
Defeated by our own technology
We don't need birth control
Our kids would wear headphones
Anyway

The last days of summer
The last days of summer
Hear the rumbling thunder
It's the last days of summer

And we'll wrestle with a stranger
By the fire
Sip some cocoa
Keep your spirits high
And we'll meet again
I know we'll meet again

We're changing like New England countryside
Our trees have intertwined
You're my black labrador
Once more
You managed to pull out Excalibur
I'll be your sorcerer
You'll keep me up all night
All right

The last days of summer
The last days of summer
Hear the rumbling thunder
It's the last days of summer

And we'll wrestle with a stranger
By the fire
Sip some cocoa
Keep your spirits high
And we'll meet again
I know we'll meet again

The last days of summer
The last days of summer
Pack up the highlander
The last days of summer
HAPPY HOUR
I'm like Stevie Ray Vaughan on the stage, high on music
Teeth grindin', sweatin' under the lights
But then my boss comes
And she's crushin' me with a 20-ton weight
Just like in Monty Python
Somebody left on the sink, it's still running
My eyes are gonna overflow

I need happy hour on sad days (on sad days)
I need happy hour, I can't wait (can't wait)

I'm like Ponce de Leon
Setting on a ship for the new world
Checking out the birds and flowers
Let's chill out on this island, I've been
Sucking on a lime and coconut (coconut)
Coconut (coconut)
I think I could stay here for the rest of my life
Please, don't ever make me go home

I need happy hour on sad days (on sad days)
It's my happy hour, I can't wait (can't wait)

Maybe I'll meet a scientist in sweatpants and a hair tie
We'll conversate about rare birds and MIDI keyboards
And we'll slow dance, head on my shoulder
Swayin' back and forth and
My friends look on and smile
Everything's gonna be alright

It's my happy hour on sad days (on sad days)
I need happy hour, I can't wait (can't wait)
I need happy hour, to save me
Maybe I'll meet a scientist in sweatpants and a hair tie
We'll conversate about rare birds and MIDI keyboards
And we'll slow dance
I need a happy hour, I can't wait (can't wait)

CHANGE THE WORLD
You want it
You got it
You flaunt it and
Get your feet on the ground
And love me right now
You like it
You hate it
You bought it and
Glued your butt to the sound
And love me right now
You couldn't change the world
To fit your little thing, ah... uh
You couldn't change the world
To fit your little thing, ah
I CAN LOVE
I didn't hope for much
I was used to how things were
Even though I was not sure
You say
I was throwing it away
And I never learned to heal
I can't believe what I see
After all this time it is meant to be
Help me believe
Believe
Believe
That I can love
I can love (x7)
I guess it goes to show
That you never should give up
Even when you're out of luck
You might
Find an angel in your sight
Who turns everything around
I can't believe what I see
After all this time it is meant to be
Help me believe
Believe
Believe
That I can love
I can love (x7)
Help me believe what I see
After all this time it is meant to be
Help me believe
Believe
Believe
That I can love
I can love
MO' BEATS
I got mo' beats than ya'll
Keep Fishin' still seems small
Is that the best that all of you can do?
Now to my challengers
Still think with little words
You're so upset, you're pissing on yourself
Wombat with the little teeth
You've been declawed with a violent fee
Trying to think of something sharp
To say to me to pierce my heart
A mob is rising up
They want to scream and shout
And tear your body limb from limb real slow
You got to focus now
Reconcentrate the chi
And get them monkeys off your back for good
Bait me, and you think I'll fall
For the words you've written up on the wall
Another performance on the ringside
And I'm not about to let the pain outside
Bait me, and you think I'll fall
For the words you've written up on the wall
Another performance on the ringside
And I'm not about to let the pain outside
Wombat with the little teeth
You've been declawed with a violent fee
Trying to think of something sharp
To say to me to pierce my heart
A mob is rising up
They want to scream and shout
And tear your body limb from limb real slow
You got to focus now
Reconcentrate the chi
And get them monkeys off your back for good
You've got to focus now.....
Hey.....hey.....
Yeah!
NOW I FINALLY SEE
Now I finally see
What it is I want
Too late too late
Surrender to her love
Now I finally see
What it is I want
HASH PIPE
I can't help my feelings, I'll go out of my mind
These players come to get me cause they'd like my behind
I can't love my business if I can't get a trick
Down on Santa Monica where tricks are for kids

Oh, come on and kick me
Oh, come on and kick me

Of men that don't bother with the taste of a teat

SUPERFRIEND
What the hell am I doing
Thinking with my willy?
Knowing I don't love her
I tell her no
Then kiss her toes

What the heck are you doing?
Leading on that poor girl
You know there's something better
Deep in you
Now let it through

Pain, pain, go away (go away)
Come again, another day (another day)
Cuz I got a friend tonight (friend tonight)
A super friend to make things right

Turn away from weakness
Turn to something better
Show me how to live right
I never noticed you
Now I worship you

Don't be talking silly
Save the sweets for the young girls
You can talk for real to me
Close your eyes
And leave the lies

Pain, pain, go away
Come again, another day
Cuz I got a friend tonight
A super friend to make things right
FAKE SMILES AND NERVOUS LAUGHTER
Grungy girls and punk rock boys
Can't be heard above the noise
Awkward handshakes, bumps and hugs
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh
It's not the way you thought it was

I would rather hear you curse me out
Than give me fake smiles
And all that nervous laughter
When you say what you hate
Makes me feel kinda great
You have authority

Taxi drivers sell their weed
My Ani DiFranco scream
Gold high tops with no socks on
Go ahead and move along

I would rather hear you curse me out
Than give me fake smiles
And all that nervous laughter
When you say what you hate
It makes me feel kinda great
You have authority
I would rather see you flip me off
Then give me fake smiles
And all that nervous laughter
When you say what you hate
Makes me feel kinda great
It's beautiful to me

It's hard to be real with all the temptations
All the flying daggers
It's hard to be true when honesty kills you
Can anybody hear me?
I'm begging darling oh
Give me a chance to let you know
It's hard to be true when honesty kills you
Can anybody hear me?

I would rather hear you curse me out
Than give me fake smiles
And all that nervous laughter
When you say what you hate
It makes me feel kinda great
You have authority
I would rather see you flip me off
Than give me fake smiles
And all that nervous laughter
When you say what you hate
Makes me feel kinda great
It's beautiful to me
ZEP JAMB
Alright

Find someone else you can be
'Cause I'm not in love with you
I'm not in love with you

Makin' love, alright

TOO MANY THOUGHTS IN MY HEAD
Stay up reading Mary Poppins
Overwhelmed by Netflix options
Boy found brains he never knew he had
Meet me there in Runyon Canyon
Fuel up, bitch, there's no more slackin'
Moses looks upon the promised land

I'm so high on cookies, it's insane

Too many thoughts in my head, now
I can't get out of my brain
They got me running in circles
Feel like I'm going insane
I had a funky night and my brain needs a break
I had a funky night and my brain needs a break
'Cause there's too many thoughts in my head, now
I can't get out of my brain

Tried to get my thoughts on paper
Comb my hair like I'm a gangster
Gotta do the dog and pony show
Algorithms sure ain't helping
Prefrontal cortex is melting
I'm going where the weather suits my clothes

I'm so high on Chopra, it's insane

Too many thoughts in my head, now
I can't get out of my brain
They got me running in circles
Feel like I'm going insane
I had a funky night and my brain needs a break
I had a funky night and my brain needs a break
'Cause there's too many thoughts in my head, now
I can't get out of my brain

I never wanted to be lonely
I never thought that life would turn out like this
I never thought that I'd feel empty
I'm really tired of this Lawrence Welk shit

Too many thoughts in my head, now
I can't get out of my brain
They got me running in circles
Feel like I'm going insane (Feel like I'm going insane)

Nothing can titillate me
Dried up like a dead battery
Throw me upon the heap
Gonna be reused, but it won't be me
Can't seem to get connected
What was the name of the network?
Dumb thoughts with a dumb program
I need a little more, a little more RAM

Too many thoughts in my head, now
I can't get out of my brain
They got me running in circles
Feel like I'm going insane
PROM NIGHT
Almost saw her heart beat
Under the necklaces
Caked-on concealer
Sorry 'bout the zit
She's a fan of 5SOS
But only cause they're so hot
Sippin' drinks at Starbucks
Didn't know what else to say

Except "hey, little girl, would you rock my world?"
Cause I love who you are, you look like a lucky star
With that makeup on, just like a young Madonna
Hey, I'm in love again
Do you remember prom night?

Your brother loves his country
Dad loves ballroom blitz
Mommy closed your Instagram
It was inappropriate
Maybe I'll go with you
Driving up Mulholland
On a teenage quest for a future husband

I said "hey, little girl, would you rock my world?"
Cause I love who you are, you look like a lucky star
With that makeup on, just like a young Madonna
Hey, I'm in love again
Do you remember prom night?

Gun me around in your sweet Chevelle
We don't need any safety belts
Blast the Scorpions, yeah
We're that cool
They're gonna play the Forum soon
Do you want to go?
But somehow we got separated
And I went back home all alone

I said "hey, little girl, would you rock my world?"
Cause I love who you are, you look like a lucky star
With that makeup on, just like a young Madonna
Hey, I'm in love again
Do you remember prom night?
Remember prom night?
Remember prom night
Oo-oo-hoo-hoo
THE GREATEST MAN THAT EVER LIVED (VARIATIONS ON A SHAKER HYMN)
You try to play cool like you just don't care
But soon I'll be playin' in your underwear
I'm like a mage with the magic spell
You come like a dog when I ring your bell
I got the money and I got the fame
You got the hots to ride on my plane
You givin' me all that I desire
Cause down with me I'm taking you higher

I'm the baddest of the bad
I'm the best that you've ever had
I'm the tops, I'm the thing
All the girls get up when I sing, yeah
I'm the meanest in the place
Step up, I'll mess with your face
I don't care where you are
Look up and follow the star

I, I'm gonna tear down the wall
I may not be here when you call
So best be givin' me your all

After the havoc that I'm gonna wreak
No more words will critics have to speak
I've got the answers to the tangled knot
Sleep tight in your cot

Oh baby, I've been told I'm goin' crazy
Oh baby, well I can't be held down
Oh baby, somehow I'm keeping it steady
Oh baby, I'm tearing up this town

Hey
This is what I like
Cut my heart with a martyr's spike
Hey, this is nothing new
I've got more than enough for you

I can take on anybody
I can do my thing
I don't wanna hurt nobody but a bee has got to sting
I'mma fix it if you mix it up, hoot, hoot
Talk smack, and I'm-a gonna shut you up, hoot, hoot

I am the greatest man that ever lived
I was born to give (I was born to give)
I am the greatest man that ever lived, oh
Radioactive (Radioactive)

Somebody said all the world's a stage
And each of us is a player
That's what I've been tryin' to tell you
In Act 1, I was struggling to survive
Nobody wanted my action dead or alive
Act 2, I hit the big time
And bodies be all up on my behind
And I can't help myself because I was born to shine
And if you don't like it, you can shove it
But you don't like it, you love it
So I'll be up here in a rage
'Til they bring the curtain down on the stage

I'm the greatest man that ever lived
I'm the greatest man that ever lived
I'm the greatest man that ever lived
I'm the greatest man that ever lived
I'm the greatest man that ever lived
I'm the greatest man that ever lived

I am the greatest man that ever lived
I was born to give and give and give
I am the greatest man that ever lived
Radioactive
I am the greatest man that ever lives
I was born to give
DA VINCI
I tried taking a picture of you
When I look at it nothing comes through
Sometimes I wonder if you’re just a ghost
And I wonder who’s haunting who most
I tried describing you to all my friends
But they just told me to polish my lens
You’re sui generis, my sweetheart
I don’t even know where to start
Even Da Vinci couldn't paint you
And Stephen Hawking can't explain you
Rosetta Stone could not translate you
I'm at a loss for words
I'm at a loss for words
I couldn't put it in a novel
I wrote a page, but it was awful
Now I just want to sing your gospel
I'm at a loss for words
I’m at a loss for words
I looked you up on ancestry.com
There was no record of Dad or of Mom
It’s like you fell straight out of the sky
And left the scholars to figure out why
I like to think that I know quite a lot
But with you it feels like I forgot
I wish that I could explain who you are
But when I try to I never get far
Even Da Vinci couldn't paint you
And Stephen Hawking can't explain you
Rosetta Stone could not translate you
I'm at a loss for words
I'm at a loss for words
I couldn't put it in a novel
I wrote a page, but it was awful
Now I just want to sing your gospel
I'm at a loss for words
I’m at a loss for words
(Oh oh oh oh)
We’ve come so far
Now here we are
We made it through the night
I know we will
Be stronger still
Everything will be alright
Even Da Vinci couldn't paint you
And Stephen Hawking can't explain you
Rosetta Stone could not translate you
I'm at a loss for words
I'm at a loss for words
I couldn't put it in a novel
I wrote a page, but it was awful
Now I just want to sing your gospel
I'm at a loss for words
I’m at a loss for words
I’m at a loss for words
Oh oh
I’m at a loss for words
(Can I tell you something?)
WORRY ROCK
Another sentimental argument and bitter love
Fucked without a kiss again and dragged it through the mud
Yelling at brick walls and punching windows made of stone
The worry rock has turned to dust and fallen on our pride
A knocked down dragged out fight
Fat lips and open wounds
Another wasted night
And no one will take the fall
Where do we go from here?
And what did you do with directions?
Promise me no dead end streets
And I'll guarantee we'll have the road
367
Now that I love you so much
And it's right there for all to see
Why don't you let me hold you
And dream of the things that should not be?
Haha haha
And so, didn't meant hurt you
I can't stand the way, it hurts
Cause I've never been worth quite what your worth
I studied the words you wrote down
And picked them apart to check your style
And as I was doing all this
You never forget to hide your smile
Haha haha
I wonder if my heart will fade
Or if this is the one
Cause I don't think I'll find a better one
It all comes crashing down
When my secret flies
Back to loneliness
I wonder if my heart will fade
Or if this is the one
Cause I don't think i'll find a better one
It all comes crashing down
When my secret flies
Back to loneliness
Now that I love you so much
And it's right there for all to see
Why don't you let me hold you
And dream of the things that should not be?
Now that I love you so much
And it's right there for all to see
Why don't you let me hold you
And dream of the things that should not be?
And dream of the things that should not be?
And dream of the things that should not be?

No, crab at the booty
T'ain't gonna do no good
IF I FELL
If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
'cause I've been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands
If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you would love me more than her
If I trust in you oh no please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too oh please
Don't hurt my pride like her
'cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain
So I hope you see love that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two
'cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain
So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two
If I fell in love with you yeah
No no no no no
WHO YOU CALLIN' BITCH?
...Who you callin' bitch?
Oh, Maria, they don’t mean it
Don’t listen to them
Oh, they make me so mad and you do nothing
Nothing to stop them
Please Maria, they mean nothing
Now you must chill out
Especially Dondo
He acts like he knows that he has a big dick
I despise him
I despise him
I despise him...
THE UNDERDOGS
Everything we fight for seems to get shot down
No one seems to notice, it's like we ain't around
They tear us into pieces and throw us here and there
No one knows how much we care
So much pain, so many tears, so much hurt
When we gonna learn?
Oh, we've got to give our best, and push until we break on through
We're shootin' straight for the top
Our engine never will stop
This is our destiny
Nothing's too good to be
We know the score, we're gonna break down the door
You wished you were at lunch, this time we've got a hunch
We're the underdogs
The people that we trusted really let us down
Everybody wants to fly and never touch the ground
They treat us like we're pieces in a parlor game
Leaving us to take the blame but we don't care
We don't mind, we won't come when they call, oh
We're taking what they give, cause we can rise above it all
We're shootin' straight for the top
Our engine never will stop
This is our destiny
Nothing's too good to be
We know the score we're gonna break down the door
You wished you were at lunch, this time we've got a hunch
We're the underdogs
Feeling the pain
Hearing their names
We struggle to, we are broken
For all this hurt, we thank you
We're shootin' straight for the top
Our engine never will stop
This is our destiny
Nothing's too good to be
We know the score we're gonna break down your door
You wished you were at lunch, this time we've got a hunch
We're the underdogs
WEEKEND WOMAN
Hey, look who's here
This place is not my home
A change has got to come
Face hot with tears
How was I supposed to know?
The ABC's of love

Salvation lies within
Don't ask me what I did
When God made her he threw away the formula

Fell in love on a Sunday
By Monday morning I drifted away
All I want is to see her
All I want is to reach my weekend woman
Just can't seem to get back there
I'm getting stuck in the weekday traffic
All I want is to see her
All I want is to reach my weekend woman

Get in, get out
No time for poetry
You can't change people's minds
I'll meet you there
Your walls are painted green
Our vines have intertwined

Was this your parting gift?
Black eye and bloody lip
Ten years from now I'll still remember every word

Fell in love on a Sunday
By Monday morning I drifted away
All I want is to see her
All I want is to reach my weekend woman
Just can't seem to get back there
I'm getting stuck in the weekday traffic
All I want is to see her
All I want is to reach my weekend woman

I still believe your beautiful lies
(I still believe your beautiful lies)
You don't have to die to go to Heaven
I still believe your beautiful lies
(I still believe your beautiful lies)
It almost makes me feel young again

Fell in love on a Sunday
By Monday morning I drifted away
All I want is to see her
All I want is to reach my weekend woman
Just can't seem to get back there
I'm getting stuck in the weekday traffic
All I want is to see her
All I want is to reach my weekend woman
All I want is to reach my weekend woman
All I want is to reach my weekend woman
All I want is to reach my weekend woman
THIEF, YOU'VE TAKEN ALL THAT WAS ME
Thief, of silent dreams
Of golden scenes
Stole away
All, it was in me
It wasn't me
Who slipped away
Now I stand with skin and bones
Without a dime to call my home
Only a voice to tell you
Thief, you've taken all that was me
Rain, It laughed so hard
It cried on me
You rain on me
Cleanse, cleanse my soul
The soul to be
The me to be
Now I stand with skin and bones
Without a dime to call my home
Only a voice to scream at you
Now I stand with skin and bones
Without a dime to call my home
Only a voice to scream at you
Thief, you've taken all that was me
Thief, you've taken all that was me
Thief, you've taken all that was me
Thief, you've taken all that was me
Now I stand with skin and bones
Without a dime to call my home
Only a voice to scream at you
Thief, you've taken all that was me
Thief, you've taken all that was me
Thief, you've taken all that was me
THIS IS SUCH A PITY
How is your heart little darling
I didn't mean to get so mad
Let me just hold you closely
How did things get so bad
I know how to pick on you
You pushed me over the edge
We caused so much agony
We can't seem to move ahead

This is such a pity
We should give all our love to each other
Not this hate that destroys us
This is such a pity
(This is a pity)
What kind of future will we have
Will we ever find peace
Everybody thinks we're crazy
They're about to call the police
I don't want to be a chump
You think I'm a fascist pig
Right now everything is black
I don't think we'll ever give

VELOURIA
Hold my head
We'll trampoline
Finally through the roof (finally through the roof)
On to somewhere near
And far in time
Velouria
Her covering (ooh)
Travelling career
She can really move
Oh velveteen!
My velouria, my velouria
Even i'll adore you
My velouria

And how does lemur skin
Reflect the sea?
Velouria
Where have you been?
My velouria, my velouria
Even i'll adore you
My velouria
We will wade in the shine of the ever
We will wade in the shine of the ever
We will wade in the tides of the summer
Every summer
Every...
My velouria
My velouria
Forevergreen
I know she's here
In California
I can see the tears
Of shastasheen
My velouria
My velouria
Even i'll adore you

MODERN DUKES
Everytime that I turn around
And just hear the same ol thing
Trucks are tryin' to rock my back
To the place I couldn't keep

I'm an asshole, storm the castle
Burn the bridges down to the ground
Take no prisoners, we're just vistors
We don't care about anything

Everytime that I turn around
And just hear the same ol crap
Trucks are trying to grease the wheels
So they can get laid back

I'm an asshole, storm the castle
Burn the bridges down to the ground
Take no prisoners, we're just vistors
We don't care about anything

That's the way the modern dukes rollin
It's every man here for himself


I'm an asshole, storm the castle
Burn the bridges down to the ground

That's the way the modern dukes rollin
It's every man here for himself
For himself
CALIFORNIA SNOW
Walk soft with a big stick, woo
Now I play guitar, it's sick, woo
This is the definition of flow, woo
Nobody cold as this, woo

California snow, never let me go
California snow, never let me go (Let me go)
'Cause I'm down (Down, down)
Yes, I'm down if you're down
California snow, never let me go (Let me go)

Back in thirty minutes, high as I can get it
Give me everything you got
I could move a mountain, solve a thorny problem
Lava's gonna flow so hot
Never worry 'bout tomorrow 'cause I'm living for today
If you see a tear fall, don't worry 'bout me, y'all
This is what it's like on top

California snow, never let me go
California snow, never let me go (Let me go)
'Cause I'm down (Down, down)
Yes, I'm down if you're down
California snow, never let me go (Let me go)

Never go against the family
All I ever have to do is sing
Never go against the family
When the root is strong, the fruit is sweet
Did you ever get to be a child?
Shake it up until it hurt?
Panic attack, stay the hell back
It's me and you against the world

Come on, Judas, give me a kiss, woo
I can't take no more of this, woo
Don't nobody look at me, woo
And nail me up by the wrists, woo

California snow, never let me go
California snow, never let me go (Let me go)
'Cause I'm down (Down, down)
Yes, I'm down if you're down
California snow, never let me go (Let me go)

(Woo)
PORK AND BEANS
They say I need some Rogaine to put in my hair
Working out at the gym to fit my underwear
Oakley makes the shades that transform a tool
You'd hate for the kids to think that you lost your cool

I'mma do the things that I wanna do
I ain't got a thing to prove to you
I'll eat my candy with the pork and beans
Excuse my manners if I make a scene
I ain't gonna wear the clothes that you like
I'm fine and dandy with the me inside
One look in the mirror and I'm tickled pink
I don't give a hoot about what you think

Everyone likes to dance to a happy song
With a catchy chorus and beat so they can sing along
Timbaland knows the way to reach the top of the charts
Maybe if I work with him, I can perfect the art

I'mma do the things that I wanna do
I ain't got a thing to prove to you
I'll eat my candy with the pork and beans
Excuse my manners if I make a scene
I ain't gonna wear the clothes that you like
I'm fine and dandy with the me inside
One look in the mirror and I'm tickled pink
I don't give a hoot about what you think

No I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care

I'mma do the things that I wanna do
I ain't got a thing to prove to you
I'll eat my candy with the pork and beans
Excuse my manners if I make a scene
I ain't gonna wear the clothes that you like
I'm fine and dandy with the me inside
One look in the mirror and I'm tickled pink
I don't give a hoot about what you think
EULOGY FOR A ROCK BAND
Goodbye heroes
You had a good run
Fifteen years of
Ruling the planet
But now your light is fadin'

Adios rock band that we loved the most
This is a toast to what you did
And all that you were fighting for
Who could do more when
Time marches on
Words come and go
We will sing the melodies that you did long ago

Women were screaming
Guys were copying you
'Cause you moved the people
To sobbing, inspiring
You spoke for the world in your songs

Adios rock band that we loved the most
This is a toast to what you did
And all that you were fighting for
Who could do more when
Time marches on
Words come and go
We will sing the melodies that you did long ago

We'll never forget the jams you made
Don't let 'em fade
It's time that we laid you in your grave
Let 'em fade
Goodbye

Adios rock band that we loved the most
This is a toast to what you did
And all that you were fighting for
Who could do more when
Time marches on
Words come and go
We will sing the melodies that you did long ago
(IF YOU'RE WONDERING IF I WANT YOU TO) I WANT YOU TO
The moon was shining on the lake at night
The Slayer T-shirt fit the scene just right
Through smeared mascara
I looked into your eyes and saw a light
You told me stories about your chickadees
They didn’t like BB guns or stupid archery
You charmed the lifeguard
He let them use the pool all day for free
Then the conversation stopped
And I looked down at my feet
I was next to you and you were right there next to me
Then I said

Girl, if you’re wondering if I want you to (I want you to)
I want you to
So make the move (make the move)
Cause I ain’t got all night
The rest of the summer was the best we’ve ever had
We watched Titanic and it didn’t make us sad
I took you to Best Buy
You took me home to meet your mom and dad
Your mom cooked meat loaf, even though I don’t eat meat
I dug you so much, I took some for the team
Your dad was silent
His eyes were fixed to what was on TV
Then the conversation stopped, and I looked down at the ring
Your folks were next to you
And you were right there next to me
And I said
Girl, if you're wondering if I want you to (I want you to)
I want you to
I swear it's true
Without you, my heart is blue

So much pain may come our way
There may come a day when we have nothing left to say
When the conversation stops and we’re facing our defeat
I’ll be next to you and you’ll be right there next to me
Then I’ll say
SANDWICHES TIME
Until a better time
You walk along that line
Love me
Love me
You do it
You do it
Until you're blue
You want it, ah
Into another place
You walk along the face
Love me
Love me
You do it
You do it
Until you're blue
You want it, ah
Sandwiches time
Sandwiches time
Sandwiches on my mind
You do it
You do it
Until you're blue
You want it, ah
Sandwiches time
Sandwiches time
Sandwiches on my mind
Into another place
Into another place
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
LONELY GIRL
My lonely girl
My lonely girl
My lonely girl
My lonely girl
So baby come on, I know how to dance
And I am the only one who ever takes a chance
Give it a try, you're not gonna die
Unless you refuse to live and hide away tonight
I'm lonely, so homely
Can't you relate?
So open your arms, and let me come in
I'd never hurt you girl 'cause that would be a sin
I'm lonely, so homely
Can't you relate?
I'm blurry, unworthy
Can't you relate?
I know you're scared, I know you're sad
But I'm here to help you realize it's not so bad
So open your arms, and let me come in
I'd never hurt you girl 'cause that would be a sin
My lonely girl
My lonely girl
My lonely girl
My lonely girl
My lonely girl (my lonely girl)
My lonely girl (my lonely girl)
My lonely girl
NO OTHER ONE
Hoo!

My girl's a liar
But I'll stand beside her
She's all I've got
And I don't wanna be alone
My girl don't see me
When she's with my friends
She's all I've got
And I don't wanna be alone

No, there is no other one
No, there is no other one
I can't have any other one
Though I would, now I never could with one

All of the drugs she does
Scare me real good
She's got a tattoo
And two pet snakes
Nobody knows me like her
Nobody knows her like me
We're all we've got
And we don't wanna be alone

No, there is no other one
No, there is no other one
I can't have any other one
Though I would, now I never could with one


No, there is no other one
No, there is no other one
I won't have any other one
Though I would, now I never could with one
REASON TO WORRY
Never ending, never to begin again
Not something you can lose
But something you can find
Another day goes into another day
You've got something to do
You've got something to find
I've got no reason to worry about anything
I've got no good reason to worry at all
I just want to see what I already know
Never ending, never to begin again
Not something you can lose
But something you can find
Another day goes right into another day
You've got something to do
You've got something to find
I've got no reason to worry about anything
I got no good reason to worry at all
I just want to see what I already know
I've got no reason to worry about anything
I got no good reason to worry at all
I just want to see what I already know
I just want to see what I already know
I just want to see what I already know
I just want to see what I already know
SIMPLE PAGES
Give me some love, give me some love
Give me some, I want you to know
Give me some love, give me some love
Sugar, that's the wrong, wrong way to go
Open your arms, open your arms
Honey, you come right back home to me
Give me some love, give me some love
Sugar, that's the wrong, wrong way to be

Can't you see?
We're to be this time
Simple pages on my mind

Kick it on back, kick it on back
Kick it on back to what you know
Give me some love, give me some love
Sugar on the hard rock radio
Where they play tunes, where they play tunes
Where they play riffs with the hard rock beat
Give me some love, give me some love, sugar
From the drop with the old school meet

Can't you see?
We're to be this time
Simple pages on my mind

Give me something I can believe, oh baby

Can't you see?
We're to be this time
Simple pages on my mind

Kick it on back, kick it on back
Kick it on back to what you know
Give me some love, give me some love
Sugar on the hard rock radio
So give me some love, give me some love
(Give me some love, give me some love
Give me some, I want you to know)
Give me some love, give me some love
(Give me some love, give me some love
Sugar on the hard rock radio)
Give me some
(Give me some love, give me some love
Give me some, I want you to know)
Can't you see?
You're just me
(Give me some love, give me some love
Sugar, that's the wrong, wrong way to go)
Turn these pages of my mind, oh, oh
(Give me some love, give me some love
Give me some, I want you to know)
Give me some love, give me some love
Sugar, that's the wrong, wrong way to go
SHE'S HAD A GIRL
She's had a girl
A child of mine
Her blood's my blood
Her eyes my eyes
I can't believe
She belongs to me
I belong to her
Even though
Now I finally see
What it is I want
Only I'm too late
Surrender she has won
POSSIBILITIES
Give it all away
Give it all away

Oh, oh
Possibilities (possibilities)
Take you home with me in your arms

I never thought
I'd do that
Take me all the way
And let your body stay

Oh, oh
Take me by the hand (take me by the hand)
Let me be the man in your arms

I never thought
I'd do that
Take me all the way
And let your body stay

Oh, you're gone (give it all away)
Oh, you're gone (give it all away)
You're gone (give it all away)
You're gone to stay


I never thought
I'd do that
Take me all the way
And let your body stay

Oh, you're gone (Give it all away)
Oh, you're gone (Give it all away)
You're gone (Give it all away)
You're gone to stay

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
I need you
I'll bleed you now
PIG
When I was a baby, I was so happy
I'd play with my friends in the mud
Wilbur and Jack and Otis and Beatty
We were a gang, you got to believe me
Mama would scold us if we got too rough
She didn't care, she was proud of us
I ran around, and talked to the animals
Tellin' 'em stories of savage cannibals
Then I got older and noticed a girl
First I was sure I didn't exist to her
I sulked around, but I didn't know why
Then she put her cheek on my shoulder and I
Was lookin' at her and she was lookin' at me
We started to smile, it was our destiny
Tina was her name, she was my cute-pie
Forgot about the things I used to like
I spent all my time followin' her around
My friends all made the whiplash sound
But they understood, they was happy for me
And everyone clapped when I asked her to marry me
And she said yes, and we felt so fine
We lost track of the passing of time
Before I knew it we had our own babies
Gina and Shelley and Keebie and Gabe

But now, I've got to die
I lived a good life, I've got no complaints
I'd like to thank Farmer Pete
For bringin' me scraps of food that I could eat
He always had a smile on his face
He didn't want to think of this day
It's finally here
It's finally here
Whoa-oh-oh
They called me Pig
They called me Pig
Oh, oh oh

When I was a baby, I was so happy
I'd play with my friends in the mud
YOUR ROOM
You're coming up worlds away
There's nothing that I can say
And all of these games you play
Will lead you to your room
You're coming up worlds away
There's nothing that I can say
And all of these games you play
Will lead you to your room
OH, LISA
Simple stages in my mind
Now I'm running out of time
I'm wanting to...
I wanna do you
Taking stock of feelings stored
Running circles overboard
I'm wanting to...
I wanna do you

Oh, lisa
Can you
Love me again?
I'll be holding on till then
Only old enough to tell
What is right and what is hell
I'm wanting to...
I wanna do you
And if this is our last goodbye
I would love to see you cry
I'm wanting to...
I wanna do you
Oh, lisa
Can you
Love me again?
I'll be holding on till then
I'll be holding on till then
Oh, lisa
Can you
Love me again?
I'll be holding on till then
If this is our last goodbye
I would love to see you cry
I'm wanting to...
I wanna do you
I wanna do you
I wanna do you
I wanna do you
WE ARE ALL ON DRUGS
When you're out with your friends
In your new Mercedes-Benz
And you're on drugs
And you show up late for school
Cause you think you're really cool
When you're on drugs
And you put on your headphones
And you step into the zone
When you're on drugs
But the world don't care
If you are or are not there
Cause you're on drugs

Give it to me
We are all on drugs, yeah
Never gettin' enough (Never gettin' enough)
We are all on drugs, yeah
Give me some of that stuff
Whoo!

And you twitch in your seat
Cause you wanna hit the street
When you're on drugs
And you cause such a fuss
Cause there's no one you can trust
When you're on drugs
And the best of your days
Will all vanish in the haze
When you're on drugs
And you wish you could quit
Cause you're really sick of it
But you're on drugs

Give it to me
We are all on drugs, yeah
Never gettin' enough (Never gettin' enough)
We are all on drugs, yeah
Give me some of that stuff
Whoo!

I want to reach a higher place
Where things will never be the same

Give it to me
We are all on drugs, yeah
Never gettin' enough (Never gettin' enough)
We are all on drugs, yeah
Give me some of that stuff
Whoo!

We are all on drugs (We are all on drugs)
We are all on drugs (We are all on drugs)
We are all on drugs (We are all on drugs)
We are all on drugs (We are all on drugs)
KING
One night at the disco, I wanted to dance slow
I saw a sweet baby, such a fine lady
And I walked up to ask her, but some dude just grabbed her
I told him to back off, cut me some slack off

I see you come here, drinkin' that cheap beer
Act like you own it, I can't condone it
You show me no respect, you got to get off it
You got to get with it, time for a swift kick

You see, I own this town, you best not come around
If you wanna get by, then cool it down
If you wanna start something, know one thing: I'm king
If you wanna mess around like that, that's just how it is
If you wanna get by, then mind your biz
If you wanna start something, know one thing: I'm king

You wanted attention, and did I mention?
Nobody likes you, except for the losers
You made a whole army, an army of babies
Some of them stupid, some of them crazy

Pick up your action, act like a grown man
Look at the winners, you could be like them
Life is so easy, pleasant and dreamy
If you get off me, if you get with me

You see I own this town, you best not come around
If you wanna get by, then cool it down
If you wanna start something, know one thing: I'm king
If you wanna mess around like that, that's just how it is
If you wanna get by, then mind your biz
If you wanna start something, know one thing: I'm king

You can't break me, never take me
That's just how it is
You can't break me, never shake me
Clear out of my biz

You see I own this town, you best not come around
If you wanna get by, then cool it down
If you wanna start something, know one thing: I'm king
If you wanna mess around like that, that's just how it is
If you wanna get by, then mind your biz
If you wanna start something, know one thing: I'm king

I'm king, I'm king
I'm king, I'm king
I'm king, I'm king
I'm king, I'm king
TROUBLEMAKER
Put me in a special school because I am such a fool
And I don't need a single book to teach me how to read
Who needs stupid books? They are for petty crooks
And I will learn by studying the lessons in my dreams
So turn off the TV because that's what others see
And movies are as bad as eating chocolate ice-cream
They only sicken me, don't let me play football
I'll sack the quarterback and jack the brother of the ball

I'm a troublemaker, never been a faker
Doing things my own way and never giving up
I'm a troublemaker, not a double-taker
I don't have the patience to keep it on the up

I picked up a guitar. What does this signify?
I'm going to play some heavy metal riffs and you will die
You wanted arts and crafts? How's this for arts and crafts?
Wuh- nuh- nuh- nuh- nuh- nuh- nuh- nuh- nuh- that's right!
I'm growing out my hair, I'm moving out to Cherokee
I'm going to be a rock star and you are going to bear with me
Because I can't work a job like any other slob
Punching in and punching out and sucking up to Bob
Marrying a beeyotch, having seven keeyods
Giving up and growing old and hoping there's a God

I'm a troublemaker, never been a faker
Doing things my own way and never giving up
I'm a troublemaker, not a double-taker
I don't have the patience to keep it on the up

I'm going to be a star and people will crane necks
To get a glimpse of me and see if I am having sex
And studying my moves, they try to understand
Why I am so unlike the singers in the other bands
I'm such a mystery as anyone can see
There isn't anybody else exactly quite like me
And when it's party time, like 1999
I'll party by myself because I'm such a special guy

I'm a troublemaker, never been a faker
Doing things my own way and never giving up
I'm a troublemaker, not a double-taker
I don't have the patience to keep it on the up

(Keep it on the up)
I'm a troublemaker
(Keep it on the up)
I'm a troublemaker
(Keep it on the up)
I'm a troublemaker
(Keep it on the up)
I'm a troublemaker
(Keep it on the up)
I'm a troublemaker
Never giving up
BURNDT JAMB
Gothic flavor
How I miss you
If I only once could kiss you

I'd be happy
For one moment
Of my lifetime
I'd be there

And the water
Running over
Me is growing
Ever colder

Make me happy
For one moment
Of my lifetime
I'd be there


Make me happy
For one moment
Of my lifetime
I'd be there


Oooh
Oooh
Oooh
EVERYBODY GET DANGEROUS
When I was younger
I used to go and tip cows for fun, yeah
Actually I didn't do that
Because I didn't want the cow to be sad
But some of my friends did
They were all just a little bit wicked
They'd blow up mail boxes
With a baseball bat
Go for direct hits
On Halloween you can forget it
They throw rotten eggs into traffic
Toilet paper the fences
Throw the tables, chairs, and the benches
After practice
Sometimes we would break into mad fits
Causing damage
(Burning amplifiers and mic stands)

Everybody get dangerous
Everybody get dangerous (Boo yah!)
Everybody get dangerous
Everybody get dangerous (Boo yah!)
Everybody get dangerous
Everybody get dangerous (Boo yah!)
Everybody get dangerous
Everybody get dangerous

I've got a confession
That I will make if you will listen
Late in the nighttimes
We'd drive around with hairspray and sharp knives
Looking for road kills
Lighting things on fire for cheap thrills
Stab the corpses
And lick the knives like we're evil forces
Hockey games on frozen ponds
No safety pads were ever put on
Driving home on country roads
Sixty-five in a twenty-five zone
In my parents Tercel
How did we survive so well
Throw the keys and the wheel locked up
I almost killed every one of us


There must be
A guardian angel
Or some kind of destiny we have
Because we should have died
A long time ago
The way that we were living in our pasts
What will we say when our kids come to us
And ask, with a smile on their face
"Hey Dad, my friend's got some new ninja swords!
Is it cool if we slash up his place?"
Hey
Hey
Hey ("Is it cool if we slash up his place?")
And get dangerous


(Ow!)
Ow!
Ow!
Gow!
Gow! (Yee, hee ha!)
Gow!)
TRAINWRECKS
We sleep all day and rock the night
We just get up to start another fight
We kiss and then we bite
We are trainwrecks
You don't keep house and I'm a slob
You're freaking out because I can't keep a job
We don't update our blogs
We are trainwrecks
People love to tell us what to do
That's just because they're jealous of me and you
We're digging through the couch for cash
We're taking cabs because both our cars are trashed
But we're still kicking ass
We are trainwrecks, trainwrecks
We're still kicking ass
We are trainwrecks
We think it's uncool to be on time
Mooching off our friends is not a Federal crime
Someday we'll cut our critics down to size
And crash a Diddy party in disguise
We fall but then we rise
We are trainwrecks
Trainwrecks
That's the story of our lives
We are trainwrecks, trainwrecks
That's the story of our lives
We are trainwrecks
HIGH UP ABOVE
Tonight you're mine
Though your fair face I can't find
I need your love
Though you leave me far behind
I really miss your love
When you're high up above
And I am waiting here
Alone and by myself
Tonight you're free
And the experts will agree
When a girl is pure
There's no better place to be
I really miss your love
When you're high up above
And I am waiting here
Alone and by myself, ah...
I really miss your love
When you're high up above
And I am waiting here
Alone and by myself, ah...
Tonight you're free
And the experts will agree
Will agree...
